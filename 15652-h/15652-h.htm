    <h2>
      BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood. One
      condition there was of too potent determining
      importance&mdash;life-long ill health; and one circumstance of
      moment&mdash;a commercial failure, and consequent expatriation.
      Beyond this, little presents itself for record in the outward
      facts of this upright and beneficial career, bright with genius
      and coruscating with wit, dark with the lengthening and deepening
      shadow of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father of Thomas Hood was engaged in business as a publisher
      and bookseller in the Poultry, in the city of London,&mdash;a
      member of the firm of Vernor, Hood, and Sharpe. He was a
      Scotchman, and had come up to the capital early in life, to make
      his way. His interest in books was not solely confined to their
      saleable quality. He reprinted various old works with success;
      published Bloomfield's poems, and dealt handsomely with him; and
      was himself the author of two novels, which are stated to have
      had some success in their day. For the sake of the son rather
      than the father, one would like to see some account, with
      adequate specimens, of these long-forgotten tales; for the
      queries which Thomas Hood asks concerning the piteous woman of
      his <i>Bridge of Sighs</i> interest us all concerning a man of
      genius, and interest us moreover with regard to the question of
      intellectual as well as natural affinity:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          "Who was his father,
        </div>
        <div>
          Who was his mother?
        </div>
        <div>
          Had he a sister,
        </div>
        <div>
          Had he a brother?"
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Another line of work in which the elder Hood is recorded to have
      been active was the opening of the English book-trade with
      America. He married a sister of the engraver Mr. Sands, and had
      by her a large family; two sons and four daughters survived the
      period of childhood. The elder brother, James, who died early of
      consumption, drew well, as did also one or two of the sisters. It
      would seem therefore, when we recall Thomas Hood's aptitudes and
      frequent miscellaneous practice in the same line, that a certain
      tendency towards fine art, as well as towards literature, ran in
      the family. The consumption which killed James appears to have
      been inherited from his mother; she, and two of her daughters,
      died of the same disease; and a pulmonary affection of a somewhat
      different kind became, as we shall see, one of the poet's most
      inveterate persecutors. The death of the father, which was sudden
      and unexpected, preceded that of the mother, but not of James,
      and left the survivors in rather straitened circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas, the second of the two sons, was born in the Poultry, on
      or about the 23d of May, 1799. He is stated to have been a
      retired child, with much quiet humor; chuckling, we may guess,
      over his own quaint imaginings, which must have come in crowds,
      and of all conceivable or inconceivable sorts, to judge from the
      products of his after years; keeping most of these fancies and
      surprises to himself, but every now and then letting some of them
      out, and giving homely or stolid bystanders an inkling of insight
      into the many-peopled crannies of his boyish brain. He received
      his education at Dr. Wanostrocht's school at Clapham. It is not
      very clear how far this education extended:<a href=
      "#fn_1">[1]</a> I should infer that it was just about enough, and
      not more than enough, to enable Hood to shift for himself in the
      career of authorship, without serious disadvantage from
      inadequate early training, and also without much aid thence
      derived&mdash;without, at any rate, any such rousing and refining
      of the literary sense as would warrant us in attributing to
      educational influences either the inclination to become an
      author, or the manipulative power over language and style which
      Hood displayed in his serious poems, not to speak of those of a
      lighter kind. We seem to see him sliding, as it were, into the
      profession of letters, simply through capacity and liking, and
      the course of events&mdash;not because he had resolutely made up
      his mind to be an author, nor because his natural faculty had
      been steadily or studiously cultivated. As to details, it may be
      remarked that his schooling included some amount&mdash;perhaps a
      fair average amount&mdash;of Latin. We find it stated that he had
      a Latin prize at school, but was not apt at the language in later
      years. He had however one kind of aptitude at it&mdash;being
      addicted to the use of familiar Latin quotations or phrases,
      cited with humorous verbal perversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the relations of family life, and the forms of family
      affection, Hood was simply exemplary. The deaths of his elder
      brother and of his father left him the principal reliance of his
      mother, herself destined soon to follow them to the tomb: he was
      an excellent and devoted son. His affection for one of his
      sisters, Anne, who also died shortly afterwards, is attested in
      the beautiful lines named <i>The Deathbed</i>,&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          "We watched her breathing through the night."
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      At a later date, the loves of a husband and a father seem to have
      absorbed by far the greater part of his nature and his thoughts:
      his letters to friends are steeped and drenched In "Jane,"
      "Fanny," and "Tom junior." These letters are mostly divided
      between perpetual family details and perennial jocularity: a
      succession of witticisms, or at lowest of puns and
      whimsicalities, mounts up like so many squibs and crackers,
      fizzing through, sparkling amid, or ultimately extinguished by,
      the inevitable shower&mdash;the steady rush and downpour&mdash;of
      the home-affections. It may easily be inferred from this account
      that there are letters which one is inclined to read more
      thoroughly, and in greater number consecutively, than Hood's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vocation first selected for Hood, towards the age of fifteen,
      was one which he did not follow up for long&mdash;that of an
      engraver. He was apprenticed to his uncle Mr. Sands, and
      afterwards to one of the Le Keux family. The occupation was
      ill-suited to his constantly ailing health, and this eventually
      conduced to his abandoning it. He then went to Scotland to
      recruit, remaining there among his relatives about five
      years.<a href="#fn_2">[2]</a> According to a statement made by
      himself, he was in a merchant's office within this interval; it
      is uncertain, however, whether this assertion is to be accepted
      as genuine, or as made for some purpose of fun. His first
      published writing appeared in the <i>Dundee Advertiser</i> in
      1814&mdash;his age being then, at the utmost, fifteen and a half;
      this was succeeded by some contribution to a local magazine. But
      as yet he had no idea of authorship as a profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the middle of the year 1820, Hood was re-settled in
      London, improved in health, and just come of age. At first he
      continued practising as an engraver; but in 1821 he began to act
      as a sort of sub-editor for the <i>London Magazine</i> after the
      death of the editor, Mr. Scott, in a duel. He concocted
      fictitious and humorous answers to correspondents&mdash;a humble
      yet appropriate introduction to the insatiable habit and faculty
      for out-of-the-way verbal jocosity which marked-off his after
      career from that of all other excellent poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first regular contribution to the magazine, in July, 1821,
      was a little poem <i>To Hope</i>: even before this, as early at
      any rate as 1815, he was in the frequent practice of writing
      correctly and at some length in verse, as witnessed by
      selections, now in print, from what he had composed for the
      amusement of his relatives. Soon afterwards, a private literary
      society was the recipient of other verses of the same order. The
      lines <i>To Hope</i> were followed, in the <i>London
      Magazine</i>, by the <i>Ode to Dr. Kitchener</i> and some further
      poems, including the important work, <i>Lycus the
      Centaur</i>&mdash;after the publication of which, there could not
      be much doubt of the genuine and uncommon powers of the new
      writer. The last contribution of Hood to this magazine was the
      <i>Lines to a Cold Beauty</i>. Another early work of his, and one
      which, like the verses <i>To the Moon</i>, affords marked
      evidence of the impression which he had received from Keats's
      poetry, is the unfinished drama (or, as he termed it, "romance")
      of <i>Lamia</i>: I do not find its precise date recorded. Its
      verse is lax, and its tone somewhat immature; yet it shows a
      great deal of sparkling and diversified talent. Hood certainly
      takes a rather more rational view than Keats did of his subject
      as a moral invention, or a myth having some sort of meaning at
      its root. A serpent transformed into a woman, who beguiles a
      youth of the highest hopes into amorous languid self-abandonment,
      is clearly not, in morals, the sort of person that ought to be
      left uncontrolled to her own devices. Keats ostentatiously
      resents the action of the unimpassioned philosopher Appollonius
      in revealing the true nature of the woman-serpent, and dissolving
      her spell. An elderly pedant to interfere with the pretty whims
      of a viper when she wears the outer semblance of a fine woman!
      Intolerable!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Such is the sentiment of Keats; but such plainly is not
      altogether the conviction of Hood, although his story remains but
      partially developed.)
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time it may have become pretty clear to himself and
      others that his proper vocation and destined profession was
      literature. Through the <i>London Magazine</i>, he got to know
      John Hamilton Reynolds (author of the <i>Garden of Florence</i>
      and other poems, and a contributor to this serial under the
      pseudonym of Edward Herbert), Charles Lamb, Allan Cunningham, De
      Quincey, and other writers of reputation. To Hood the most
      directly important of all these acquaintances was Mr. Reynolds;
      this gentleman having a sister, Jane, to whom Hood was
      introduced. An attachment ensued, and shortly terminated in
      marriage, the wedding taking place on the 5th of May, 1824. The
      father of Miss Reynolds was the head writing-master at Christ
      Hospital. She is stated to have had good manners, a cultivated
      mind, and literary tastes, though a high educational standard is
      not always traceable in her letters. At any rate the marriage was
      a happy one; Mrs. Hood being a tender and attentive wife,
      unwearied in the cares which her husband's precarious health
      demanded, and he being (as I have said) a mirror of marital
      constancy and devotion, distinguishable from a lover rather by
      his intense delight in all domestic relations and details than by
      any cooling-down in his fondness. It would appear that, in the
      later years of Hood's life, he was not on entirely good terms
      with some members of his wife's family, including his old friend
      John Hamilton Reynolds. What may have caused this I do not find
      specified: all that we know of the character of Hood justifies us
      in thinking that he was little or not at all to blame, for he
      appears throughout a man of just, honorable, and loving nature,
      and free besides from that sort of self-assertion which invites a
      collision. Every one, however, has his blemishes; and we may
      perhaps discern in Hood a certain over-readiness to think himself
      imposed upon, and the fellow-creatures with whom he had
      immediately to do a generation of vipers&mdash;a state of feeling
      not characteristic of a mind exalted and magnanimous by habit, or
      "gentle" in the older and more significant meaning of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was now come for Hood to venture a volume upon the
      world. Conjointly with Reynolds, he wrote, and published in 1825,
      his <i>Odes and Addresses to Great People</i>. The title-page
      bore no author's name; but the extraordinary talent and point of
      the work could hardly fail to be noticed, even apart from its
      appeal to immediate popularity, dealing as it did so continually
      with the uppermost topics of the day. It had what it deserved, a
      great success. This volume was followed, in 1826, by the first
      series of <i>Whims and Oddities</i>, which also met with a good
      sale; the second series appeared in 1827. Next came two volumes
      of <i>National Tales</i>, somewhat after the manner of Boccaccio
      (but how far different from his spirit may easily be surmised),
      which are now little known. The volume containing the <i>Plea of
      the Midsummer Fairies, Hero and Leander</i>, and some other of
      Hood's most finished and noticeable poems, came out in 1827.
      <i>The Midsummer Fairies</i> itself was one of the authors own
      favorite works, and certainly deserved to be so, as far as dainty
      elegance of motive and of execution is concerned: but the
      conception was a little too ingeniously remote for the public to
      ratify the author's predilection. The <i>Hero and Leander</i>
      will be at once recognized as modelled on the style of
      Elizabethan narrative poems: indeed Marlow treated the very same
      subject, and his poem, left uncompleted, was finished by Chapman.
      Hood's is a most astonishing example of revivalist poetry: it is
      reproductive and spontaneous at the same time. It resembles its
      models closely, not servilely&mdash;significantly, not
      mechanically; and has the great merit of resembling them with
      comparative moderation. Elizabethan here both in spirit and in
      letter, Hood is nevertheless a little less extreme than his
      prototypes. Where they loaded, he does not find it needful to
      overload, which is the ready and almost the inevitable resource
      of revivalists, all but the fewest: on the contrary, he
      alleviates a little,&mdash;but only a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1829 appeared the most famous of all his poems of a narrative
      character&mdash;<i>The Dream of Eugene Aram</i>; it was published
      in the <i>Gem</i>, an annual which the poet was then editing.
      Besides this amount of literary activity, Hood continued writing
      in periodicals, sometimes under the signature of "Theodore M."
    </p>
    <p>
      His excessive and immeasurable addiction to rollicking fun, to
      the perpetual "cracking of jokes" (for it amounts to that more
      definitely than to anything else in the domain of the Comic
      Muse), is a somewhat curious problem, taken in connection with
      his remarkable genius and accomplishment as a poet, and his
      personal character as a solid housekeeping citizen, bent chiefly
      upon rearing his family in respectability, and paying his way,
      or, as the Church Catechism has neatly and unimprovably expressed
      it, upon "doing his duty in that state of life to which it had
      pleased God to call him." His almost constant ill-health, and, in
      a minor degree, the troubles which beset him in money-matters,
      make the problem all the more noticeable. The influence of
      Charles Lamb may have had something to do with it,&mdash;probably
      not very much. Perhaps there was something in the literary
      atmosphere or the national tone of the time which gave comicality
      a turn of predominance after the subsiding of the great poetic
      wave which filled the last years of the eighteenth and the first
      quarter of the nineteenth century in our country, in Blake,
      Burns, Wordsworth, Scott, Coleridge, Landor, Byron, Keats, and,
      supreme among all, Shelley. Something of the same transition may
      be noticed in the art of design; the multifarious illustrator in
      the prior generation is Stothard,&mdash;in the later, Cruikshank.
      At any rate, in literature, Lamb, Hood, and then Dickens in his
      earliest works, the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> and <i>Pickwick</i>,
      are uncommonly characteristic and leading minds, and bent, with
      singular inveteracy, upon being "funny,"&mdash;though not funny
      and nothing else at all. But we should not force this
      consideration too far: Hood is a central figure in the group and
      the period, and the tendency of the time may be almost as much
      due to him as he to the tendency. Mainly, we have to fall back
      upon his own idiosyncrasy: he was born with a boundlessly
      whimsical perception, which he trained into an inimitable
      sleight-of-hand in the twisting of notions and of words;
      circumstances favored his writing for fugitive publications and
      skimming readers, rather than under conditions of greater
      permanency; and the result is as we find it in his works. His son
      expresses the opinion that part of Hood's success in comic
      writing arose from his early reading of <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>,
      <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, and other works of that
      period, and imbuing himself with their style: a remark, however,
      which applies to his prose rather than his poetical works.
      Certain it is that the appetite for all kinds of fun, verbal and
      other was a part of Hood's nature. We see it in the practical
      jokes he was continually playing on his good-humored
      wife&mdash;such as altering into grotesque absurdity many of the
      words contained in her letters to friends: we see it&mdash;the
      mere animal love of jocularity, as it might be termed&mdash;in
      such a small point as his frequently addressing his friend Philip
      de Franck, in letters, by the words, "Tim, says he," instead of
      any human appellative<a href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Hood reminds us very
      much of one of Shakespeare's Fools (to use the word in no
      invidious sense) transported into the nineteenth
      century,&mdash;the Fool in <i>King Lear</i>, or Touchstone. For
      the occasional sallies of coarseness or ribaldry, the spirit of
      the time has substituted a <i>bourgeois</i> good-humor which
      respects the family circle, and haunts the kitchen-stairs; for
      the biting jeer, intended to make some victim uncomfortable, it
      gives the sarcastic or sprightly banter, not unconscious of an
      effort at moral amelioration; for the sententious sagacity, and
      humorous enjoyment of the nature of man, it gives bright thoughts
      and a humanitarian sympathy. But, on the whole, the intellectual
      personality is nearly the same: seeking by natural affinity, and
      enjoying to the uttermost, whatever tends to lightness of heart
      and to ridicule&mdash;thus dwelling indeed in the region of the
      commonplace and the gross, but constantly informing it with some
      suggestion of poetry, somewise side-meaning, or some form of
      sweetness and grace. These observations relate of course to
      Hood's humorous poems: into his grave and pathetic poems he can
      import qualities still loftier than these&mdash;though even here
      it is not often that he utterly forswears quaintness and oddity.
      The risible, the fantastic, was his beacon-light; sometimes as
      delicate as a dell of glow-worms; sometimes as uproarious as a
      bonfire; sometimes, it must be said (for he had to be perpetually
      writing whether the inspiration came or not, or his inspiration
      was too liable to come from the very platitudes and pettinesses
      of everyday life), not much more brilliant than a rush-light, and
      hardly more aromatic than the snuff of a tallow candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now glance again at Hood's domestic affairs. His first
      child had no mundane existence worth calling such; but has
      nevertheless lived longer than most human beings in the lines
      which Lamb wrote for the occasion, <i>On an Infant dying as soon
      as born</i>. A daughter followed, and in 1830 was born his son,
      the Tom Hood who became editor of the comic journal <i>Fun</i>,
      and died in 1874. At the time of his birth, the family was living
      at Winchmore Hill: thence they removed about 1832, to the Lake
      House, Wanstead, a highly picturesque dwelling, but scanty in
      domestic comforts. The first of the <i>Comic Annual</i> series
      was brought out at Christmas, 1830. In the following couple of
      years, Hood did some theatrical work; writing the libretto for an
      English opera which (it is believed) was performed at the Surrey
      Theatre. Its name is now unknown, but it had a good run in its
      day; a similar fate has befallen an entertainment which he wrote
      for Mathews. He also composed a pantomime for the Adelphi; and,
      along with Reynolds, dramatized <i>Gil Blas</i>. This play is
      understood to have been acted at Drury Lane. The novel of
      <i>Tylney Hall</i>, and the poem of the <i>Epping Hunt</i>, were
      written at Wanstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born in comfortable mediocrity, and early inured to narrow
      fortunes, Hood had no doubt entered upon the literary calling
      without expecting or caring to become rich. Hitherto, however, he
      seems to have prospered progressively, and to have had no reason
      to regret, even in a wordly sense, his choice of a profession.
      But towards the end of 1834 a disaster overtook him; and
      thenceforth, to the end of his days, he had nothing but tedious
      struggling and uphill work. To a man of his buoyant temperament,
      and happy in his home, this might have been of no extreme
      consequence, if only sound health had blessed him: unfortunately,
      the very reverse was the case. Sickly hitherto, he was soon to
      become miserably and hopelessly diseased: he worked on through
      everything bravely and uncomplainingly, but no doubt with keen
      throbs of discomfort, and not without detriment at times to the
      quality of his writings. The disaster adverted to was the failure
      of a firm with which Hood was connected, entailing severe loss
      upon him. With his accustomed probity, he refused to avail
      himself of any legal immunities, and resolved to meet his
      engagements in full eventually; but it became requisite that he
      should withdraw from England. He proposed to settle down in some
      one of the towns on the Rhine, and circumstances fixed his choice
      on Coblentz. A great storm which overtook him during the passage
      to Rotterdam told damagingly on his already feeble health.
      Coblentz, which he reached in March, 1835, pleased him at first;
      though it was not long before he found himself a good deal of an
      Englishman, and his surroundings vexatiously German. After a
      while he came to consider a German Jew and a Jew German nearly
      convertible terms; and indulged at times in considerable acrimony
      of comment, such as a reader of cosmopolitan temper is not
      inclined to approve. He had, however, at least one very agreeable
      acquaintance at Coblentz&mdash;Lieutenant Philip de Franck, an
      officer in the Prussian service, of partly English parentage: the
      good-fellowship which he kept up with this amiable gentleman,
      both in personal intercourse and by letter, was (as we have seen)
      even boyishly vivacious and exuberant. In the first instance Hood
      lived at No. 372 Castor Hof, where his family joined him in the
      Spring of 1835: about a year later, they removed to No. 752 Alten
      Graben.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spasms in the chest now began to be a trying and alarming symptom
      of his ill-health, which, towards the end of 1836, took a turn
      for the worse; he never afterwards rallied very effectually,
      though the fluctuations were numerous&mdash;(in November, 1838,
      for instance, he fancied that a radical improvement had suddenly
      taken place)&mdash;and at times the danger was imminent. The
      unfavorable change in question was nearly simultaneous with a
      visit which he made to Berlin, accompanying Lieutenant de Franck
      and his regiment, on their transfer to Bromberg: the rate of
      travelling was from fifteen to twenty English miles per diem, for
      three days consecutively, and then one day of rest. Hood liked
      the simple unextortionate Saxon folk whom he encountered on the
      route, and contrasted them with the Coblentzers, much to the
      disadvantage of the latter. By the beginning of December he was
      back in his Rhineland home; but finally quitted it towards May,
      1837. Several attacks of blood-spitting occurred in the interval;
      at one time Hood proposed for himself the deadly-lively epitaph,
      "Here lies one who spat more blood and made more puns than any
      other man."
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time he was engaged in writing <i>Up the Rhine</i>;
      performing, as was his wont, the greater part of the work during
      the night-hours. The sojourn at Coblentz was succeeded by a
      sojourn at Ostend; in which city&mdash;besides the sea, which
      Hood always supremely delighted in&mdash;he found at first more
      comfort in the ordinary mode of living, including the general
      readiness at speaking or understanding English. Gradually,
      however, the climate, extremely damp and often cold, proved
      highly unsuitable to him; and, when he quitted Ostend in the
      Spring of 1840, at the close of nearly three years' residence
      there, it was apparent that his stay had already lasted too long.
      Within this period the publication of <i>Hood's Own</i> had
      occurred, and put to a severe trial even <i>his</i> unrivalled
      fertility in jest: one of his letters speaks of the difficulty of
      being perfectly original in the jocose vein, more especially with
      reference to the concurrent demands of <i>Hood's Own</i>, and of
      the <i>Comic Annual</i> of the year. At the beginning of 1839 he
      paid a visit of about three weeks to his often-regretted England,
      staying with one of his oldest and most intimate friends, Mr.
      Dilke, then editor of the <i>Athenæum</i>. Another of his best
      friends&mdash;one indeed who continued to the end roost unwearied
      and affectionate in his professional and other attentions, Dr.
      Elliot&mdash;now made a medical examination of Hood's condition.
      He pronounced the lungs to be organically sound; the chief seat
      of disease being the liver, and the heart, which was placed lower
      down than usual. At a later stage of the disease, enlargement of
      the heart is mentioned, along with hæmorrhage from the lungs
      consequent on that malady, and recurring with terrible frequency:
      to these dropsy, arising from extreme weakness, was eventually
      superadded. Indeed, the catalogue of the illnesses of the
      unconquerably hilarious Hood, and the details of his sufferings,
      are painful to read. They have at least the merit of giving a
      touch of adventitious but intimate pathos even to some of his
      wildest extravagances of verbal fence,&mdash;and of enhancing our
      sympathy and admiration for the force and beauty of his personal
      character, which could produce work such as this out of a torture
      of body and spirit such as that. During this visit to London,
      Hood scrutinized his publishing and other accounts, and found
      them sufficiently encouraging. The first edition of <i>Up the
      Rhine</i>, consisting of 1500 copies, sold off In a fortnight.
      Soon, however, some vexations with publishers ensued: Hood felt
      it requisite to take legal proceedings, and the action lingered
      on throughout and beyond the brief remainder of his life. Thus
      his prospects were again blighted, and his means crippled when
      most they needed to be unembarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet was back in England from Ostend in April 1840; and,
      under medical advice, he determined to prolong his visit into a
      permanent re-settlement in his native London. Here therefore he
      remained and returned, no more to the Continent. He took a house,
      with his family, in Camberwell, not far from the Green; removing
      afterwards to St. John's Wood, and finally to another house in
      the same district, Devonshire Lodge, Finchley Road. He wrote in
      the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, then edited by Theodore Hook:
      his <i>Rhymes for the Times</i>, the celebrated <i>Miss
      Kilmansegg</i>, and other compositions, first appeared here. Hook
      dying in August 1841, Hood was invited to succeed him as editor,
      and closed with the offer: this gave him an annual salary of
      £300, besides the separate payments for any articles that he
      wrote. The <i>Song of the Shirt</i>, which it would be futile to
      praise or even to characterize, came out, anonymously of course,
      in the Christmas number of <i>Punch</i> for 1843: it ran like
      wildfire, and rang like a tocsin, through the land. Immediately
      afterwards, in January 1844, Hood's connection with the <i>New
      Monthly</i> closed, and he started a publication of his own,
      <i>Hood's Magazine</i>, which was a considerable success: more
      than half the first number was the actual handiwork of the
      editor. Many troubles and cross-purposes, however, beset the new
      periodical; difficulties with which Hood was ill fitted, by his
      now rapidly and fatally worsening health, to cope. They pestered
      him when he was most in need of rest; and he was in need of rest
      when most he was wanted to control the enterprise. <i>The Haunted
      House</i>, and various other excellent poems by Hood, were
      published in this magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last days and final agonies were a little cheered by the
      granting of a Government pension of £100, dating from June 1844,
      which, with kindly but ominous foresight, was conferred upon Mrs.
      Hood, as likely to prove the survivor. This was during the
      ministry of Sir Robert Peel, whose courteous communications to
      the poet, and expressions of direct personal interest in his
      writings, made the boon all the more acceptable. Hood, indeed,
      had not been directly concerned in soliciting it. At a somewhat
      earlier date, January 1841, the Literary Society had, similarly
      unasked, voted him a sum of £50; but this he returned, although
      his circumstances were such as might have made it by no means
      unwelcome. From Christmas 1844 he was compelled to take to his
      bed, and was fated never to leave his room again. The ensuing
      Spring, throughout which the poet lay seemingly almost at the
      last gasp day by day, was a lovely one. At times he was
      delirious; but mostly quite clear in mind, and full of gentleness
      and resignation. "Dying, dying," were his last words; and shortly
      before, "Lord, say 'Arise, take up thy cross, and follow me.'" On
      the 3d of May 1845 he lay dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hood's funeral took place in Kensal Green Cemetery: it was a
      quiet one, but many friends attended. His faithful and loving
      wife would not be long divided from him. Eighteen months later
      she was laid beside him, dying of an illness first contracted
      from her constant tendance on his sick-bed. In the closing period
      of his life, Hood could hardly bear her being out of his sight,
      or even write when she was away. Some years afterwards, a public
      subscription was got up, and a monument erected to mark the grave
      of the good man and true poet who "sang the Song of the Shirt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Hood is best known by two busts and an oil-portrait
      which have both been engraved from. It is a sort of face to which
      apparently a bust does more than justice, yet less than right.
      The features, being mostly by no means bad ones, look better,
      when thus reduced to the mere simple and abstract contour, than
      they probably showed in reality, for no one supposed Hood to be a
      fine-looking man; on the other hand, the <i>value</i> of the face
      must have been in its shifting expression&mdash;keen, playful, or
      subtle&mdash;and this can be but barely suggested by the
      sculptor. The poet's visage was pallid, his figure slight, his
      voice feeble; he always dressed in black, and is spoken of as
      presenting a generally clerical aspect. He was remarkably
      deficient in ear for music&mdash;not certainly for the true chime
      and varied resources of verse. His aptitude for the art of design
      was probably greater than might be inferred from the many comic
      woodcut-drawings which he has left. These are irresistibly
      ludicrous&mdash;(who would not laugh over "The Spoiled
      Child"&mdash;"What next? as the Frog said when his tail fell
      off"&mdash;and a host of others?)&mdash;and all the more
      ludicrous and effective for being drawn more childishly and less
      artistically than was within Hood's compass. One may occasionally
      see some water-color landscape-bit or the like from his hands
      pleasantly done; and during his final residence in England he
      acted upon an idea he had long entertained, and produced some
      little in the way of oil-painting. He was also ingenious in any
      sort of light fancy-work&mdash;such, for instance, as carving the
      scenery for a child's theatre which formed the delight of his
      little son and daughter. His religious faith was, according to
      the writers of the <i>Memorials</i>, deep and sincere, though his
      opposition to sectarian narrowness and spite of all sorts was
      vigorous, and caused him sometimes to be regarded as
      anti-religious. A letter of his to a tract-giving and piously
      censorious lady who had troubled him (published in the same book)
      is absolutely fierce, and indeed hardly to be reconciled with the
      courtesy due to a woman, as a mere question of sex. It would be
      convenient, I may observe, to know more plainly what the
      biographers mean by such expressions as "religious faith,"
      "Christian gentleman," and the like. They are not explained, for
      instance, by adding that Hood honored the Bible too much to make
      it a task-book for his children. "Religious faith" covers many
      very serious differences of sentiment and conviction, between
      natural theology and historical Christianity; and, on hearing
      that a man possessed religious faith, one would like to learn
      which of the two extremes this faith was more nearly conversant
      with. In respect of political or social opinion, Hood appears to
      have been rather humane and philanthropic than democratic, or
      "liberal" in the distinct technical sense. His favorite theory of
      government, as he said in a letter to Peel, was "an angel from
      heaven, and a despotism." He loved neither whigs nor tories, but
      was on the side of a national policy: war was his abhorrence, and
      so were the wicked corn-laws&mdash;an oligarchical device which
      survived him, but not for long. His private generosity, not the
      less true or hearty for the limits which a precarious and very
      moderate income necessarily imposed on it, was in accordance with
      the general sentiments of kindness which he was wont to express
      both in public and private: if he preached, he did not forget to
      practise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been well said<a href="#fn_4">[4]</a> that "the
      predominant characteristics of his genius are humorous fancies
      grafted upon melancholy impressions." Yet the term "grafted"
      seems hardly strong enough. Hood appears, by natural bent and
      permanent habit of mind, to have seen and sought for
      ludicrousness under all conditions&mdash;it was the first thing
      that struck him as a matter of intellectual perception or choice.
      On the other hand, his nature being poetic, his sympathies acute,
      and the condition of his life morbid, he very frequently wrote in
      a tone of deep and indeed melancholy feeling, and was a master
      both of his own art and of the reader's emotion; but, even in
      work of this sort, the intellectual execration, when it takes
      precedence of the general feeling, is continually fantastic,
      grotesque, or positively mirthful. And so again with those of his
      works&mdash;including rude designs along with finished or
      off-hand writing&mdash;which are professedly comical: the funny
      twist of thought is the essential thing, and the most gloomy or
      horrible subject-matter is often selected as the occasion for the
      horse-laugh. In some of his works indeed (we might cite the poems
      named <i>The Dead Robbery</i>, <i>The Forge</i>, and <i>The
      Supper Superstition</i>) the horse-laugh almost passes into a
      nightmare laugh. A ghoul might seem to have set it going, and
      laughing hyenas to be chorusing it. A man of such a faculty and
      such a habit of work could scarcely, in all instances, keep
      himself within the bounds of good taste&mdash;a term which people
      are far too ready to introduce into serious discussions, for the
      purpose of casting disparagement upon some work which transcends
      the ordinary standards of appreciation, but a term nevertheless
      which has its important meaning and its true place. Hood is too
      often like a man grinning awry, or interlarding serious and
      beautiful discourse with a nod, a wink, or a leer, neither
      requisite nor convenient as auxiliaries to his speech: and to do
      either of these things is to fail in perfect taste. Sometimes,
      not very often, we are allowed to reach the close of a poem of
      his without having our attention jogged and called off by a
      single interpolation of this kind; and then we feel
      unalloyed&mdash;what we constantly feel also even under the
      contrary conditions&mdash;how exquisite a poetic sense and how
      choice a cunning of hand were his. On the whole, we can pronounce
      Hood the finest English poet between the generation of Shelley
      and the generation of Tennyson.

          And play to me so cheerily;

          The future bliss thy constant theme.

          Away, like phantoms of a dream;

          Where thou wouldst sit and smile, and show,

          By many a story of love and glory,

        </h4>
        <div>
          Summer is gone on swallows' wings,
        </div>
        <div>
          And Earth has buried all her flowers:
        </div>
        <div>
          No more the lark,&mdash;the linnet&mdash;sings,
        </div>
        <div>
          But Silence sits in faded bowers.
        </div>
        <div>
          There is a shadow on the plain
        </div>
        <div>
          Of Winter ere he comes again,&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          There is in woods a solemn sound
        </div>
        <div>
          Of hollow warnings whisper'd round,
        </div>
        <div>
          As Echo in her deep recess
        </div>
        <div>
          For once had turn'd a prophetess.
        </div>
        <div>
          Shuddering Autumn stops to list,
        </div>
        <div>
          And breathes his fear in sudden sighs,
        </div>
        <div>
          With clouded face, and hazel eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          That quench themselves, and hide in mist.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">
          Yes, Summer's gone like pageant bright;
        </div>
        <div>
          Its glorious days of golden light
        </div>
        <div>
          Are gone&mdash;the mimic suns that quiver,
        </div>
        <div>
          Then melt in Time's dark-flowing river.
        </div>
        <div>
          Gone the sweetly-scented breeze
        </div>
        <div>
          That spoke in music to the trees;
        </div>
        <div>
          Gone&mdash;for damp and chilly breath,
        </div>
        <div>
          As if fresh blown o'er marble seas,
        </div>
        <div>
          Or newly from the lungs of Death.
        </div>
        <div>
          Gone its virgin roses' blushes,
        </div>
        <div>
          Warm as when Aurora rushes
        </div>
        <div>
          Freshly from the God's embrace,
        </div>
        <div>
          With all her shame upon her face.
        </div>
        <div>
          Old Time hath laid them in the mould;
        </div>
        <div>
          Sure he is blind as well as old,
        </div>
        <div>
          Whose hand relentless never spares
        </div>
        <div>
          Young cheeks so beauty-bright as theirs!
        </div>
        <div>
          Gone are the flame-eyed lovers now
        </div>
        <div>
          From where so blushing-blest they tarried
        </div>
        <div>
          Under the hawthorn's blossom-bough,
        </div>
        <div>
          Gone; for Day and Night are married.
        </div>
        <div>
          All the light of love is fled:&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Alas! that negro breasts should hide
        </div>
        <div>
          The lips that were so rosy red,
        </div>
        <div>
          At morning and at even-tide!

          Delightful Summer! then adieu

        <div>
          But who without regretful sigh
        </div>
        <div>
          Can say, adieu, and see thee fly?
        </div>
        <div>
          Not he that e'er hath felt thy pow'r.
        </div>
        <div>
          His joy expanding like a flow'r,
        </div>
        <div>
          That cometh after rain and snow,
        </div>
        <div>
          Looks up at heaven, and learns to glow:&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Not he that fled from Babel-strife
        </div>
        <div>
          To the green sabbath-land of life,
        </div>
        <div>
          To dodge dull Care 'mid clustered trees,
        </div>
        <div>
          And cool his forehead in the breeze,&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Whose spirit, weary-worn perchance,
        </div>
        <div>
          Shook from its wings a weight of grief,
        </div>
        <div>
          And perch'd upon an aspen leaf,
        </div>
        <div>
          For every breath to make it dance.

          Farewell!&mdash;on wings of sombre stain,

          Thou fly'st; but thou wilt come again

          On the gay wings of butterflies.
        </div>
        <div>
          Spring at thy approach will sprout

        <div>
          Her new Corinthian beauties out,
        </div>
        <div>
          Leaf-woven homes, where twitter-words
        </div>
        <div>
          Will grow to songs, and eggs to birds;
        </div>
        <div>
          Ambitious buds shall swell to flowers,

        <div>
          And April smiles to sunny hours,

        <div>
          Bright days shall be, and gentle nights

        <div>
          Full of soft breath and echo-lights,
        </div>
        <div>
          As if the god of sun-time kept
        </div>
        <div>
          His eyes half-open while he slept.
        </div>
        <div>
          Roses shall be where roses were,

        <div>
          Not shadows, but reality;

        <div>
          As if they never perished there,
        </div>
        <div>
          But slept in immortality:
        </div>
        <div>
          Nature shall thrill with new delight,
        </div>
        <div>
          And Time's relumined river run
        </div>
        <div>
          Warm as young blood, and dazzling bright,

          A thing half-breathing and half-warm,

          THE ARGUMENT.
        </h5>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Lycus, detained by Circe in her magical dominion, is
            beloved by a Water Nymph, who, desiring to render him
            immortal, has recourse to the Sorceress. Circe gives her an
            incantation to pronounce, which should turn Lycus into a
            horse; but the horrible effect of the charm causing her to
            break off in the midst, he becomes a Centaur.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <div>
          Who hath ever been lured and bound by a spell
        </div>
        <div>
          To wander, fore-doomed, in that circle of hell
        </div>
        <div>
          Where Witchery works with her will like a god,
        </div>
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          At a word,&mdash;at a touch,&mdash;at a flash of the eye,
        </div>
        <div>
          But each form is a cheat, and each sound is a lie,
        </div>
        <div>
          Things born of a wish&mdash;to endure for a thought,

          Or last for long ages&mdash;to vanish to nought,
        </div>
        <div>
          Or put on new semblance? O Jove, I had given
        </div>
        <div>
          The throne of a kingdom to know if that heaven,

          The face I might dote on, should live out the lease

          Of the charm that created, and suddenly cease:
        </div>
        <div>
          And I gave me to slumber, as if from one dream
        </div>
        <div>
          To another&mdash;each horrid,&mdash;and drank of the stream
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a first taste of blood, lest as water I quaff'd
        </div>
        <div>
          Swift poison, and never should breathe from the
          draught,&mdash;

          Such drink as her own monarch husband drain'd up

          When he pledged her, and Fate closed his eyes in the cup.
        </div>
        <div>
          And I pluck'd of the fruit with held breath, and a fear
        </div>
        <div>
          That the branch would start back and scream out in my ear;
        </div>
        <div>
          For once, at my suppering, I plucked in the dusk
        </div>
        <div>
          An apple, juice-gushing and fragrant of musk;
        </div>

          But by daylight my fingers were crimson'd with gore,

          And once&mdash;only once&mdash;for the love of its blush,
        </div>
        <div>
          I broke a bloom bough, but there came such a gush
        </div>
        <div>
          On my hand, that it fainted away in weak fright,

          And oh! such an agony thrill'd in that note,
        </div>
        <div>
          That my soul, startling up, beat its wings in my throat,
        </div>

        </div>
        <div>
          I drank of the stream, but no poison was in it;

          I plunged in its waters, but ere I could sink,
        </div>
        <div>

          Strange death, but with woman's attraction of eyes;
        </div>
        <div>
          The tall ugly ape, that still bore a dim shine
        </div>
        <div>
          Through his hairy eclipse of a manhood divine;
        </div>
        <div>
          And the elephant stately, with more than its reason,
        </div>
        <div>
          How thoughtful in sadness! but this is no season
        </div>
        <div>
          To reckon them up from the lag-bellied toad
        </div>
        <div>
          To the mammoth, whose sobs shook his ponderous load.
        </div>
        <div>
          There were woes of all shapes, wretched forms, when I came,
        </div>
        <div>
          That hung down their heads with a human-like shame;
        </div>
        <div>
          The elephant hid in the boughs, and the bear
        </div>
        <div>
          Shed over his eyes the dark veil of his hair;
        </div>
        <div>
          And the womanly soul turning sick with disgust,
        </div>
        <div>
          Tried to vomit herself from her serpentine crust;
        </div>
        <div>
          While all groan'd their groans into one at their lot,
        </div>
        <div>
          As I brought them the image of what they were not.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Then rose a wild sound of the human voice choking
        </div>
        <div>
          Through vile brutal organs&mdash;low tremulous croaking:
        </div>
        <div>
          Cries swallow'd abruptly&mdash;deep animal tones
        </div>
        <div>
          Attuned to strange passion, and full-utter'd groans;
        </div>
        <div>
          All shuddering weaken, till hush'd in a pause
        </div>
        <div>
          Of tongues in mute motion and wide-yawning jaws;
        </div>
        <div>
          And I guessed that those horrors were meant to tell o'er
        </div>
        <div>
          The tale of their woes; but the silence told more,
        </div>
        <div>
          That writhed on their tongues; and I knelt on the sod,
        </div>
        <div>
          And pray'd with my voice to the cloud-stirring god,
        </div>
        <div>
          For the sad congregation of supplicants there,
        </div>
        <div>
          That upturn'd to his heaven brute faces of prayer;
        </div>
        <div>
          And I ceased, and they utter'd a moaning so deep,
        </div>
        <div>
          That I wept for my heart-ease,&mdash;but they could not weep,
        </div>
        <div>
          And gazed with red eyeballs, all wistfully dry,
        </div>
        <div>
          At the comfort of tears in a stag's human eye.
        </div>
        <div>
          Then I motion'd them round, and, to soothe their distress,
        </div>
        <div>
          I caress'd, and they bent them to meet my caress,
        </div>
        <div>
          Their necks to my arm, and their heads to my palm,
        </div>
        <div>
          And with poor grateful eyes suffer'd meekly and calm
        </div>
        <div>
          Those tokens of kindness, withheld by hard fate
        </div>
        <div>
          From returns that might chill the warm pity to hate;
        </div>
        <div>
          So they passively bow'd&mdash;save the serpent, that leapt
        </div>
        <div>
          To my breast like a sister, and pressingly crept
        </div>
        <div>
          In embrace of my neck, and with close kisses blister'd
        </div>
        <div>
          My lips in rash love,&mdash;then drew backward, and glister'd
        </div>
        <div>
          Her eyes in my face, and loud hissing affright,
        </div>
        <div>
          Dropt down, but swift started away from my sight!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          This sorrow was theirs, but thrice wretched my lot,
        </div>
        <div>
          Turn'd brute in my soul, though my body was not,
        </div>
        <div>
          When I fled from the sorrow of womanly faces,
        </div>
        <div>
          That shrouded their woe in the shade of lone places,
        </div>
        <div>
          And dash'd off bright tears, till their fingers were wet,
        </div>
        <div>
          And then wiped their lids with long tresses of jet:
        </div>
        <div>
          But I fled&mdash;though they stretch'd out their hands, all
          entangled
        </div>
        <div>
          With hair, and blood-stain'd of the breasts they had
          mangled,&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Though they call'd&mdash;and perchance but to ask, had I seen
        </div>
        <div>
          Their loves, or to tell the vile wrongs that had been:
        </div>
        <div>
          But I stayed not to hear, lest the story should hold
        </div>
        <div>
          Some hell-form of words, some enchantment, once told,
        </div>
        <div>
          Might translate me in flesh to a brute; and I dreaded
        </div>
        <div>
          To gaze on their charms, lest my faith should be wedded
        </div>
        <div>
          With some pity,&mdash;and love in that pity perchance&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          To a thing not all lovely; for once at glance,
        </div>
        <div>
          Methought, where one sat, I descried a bright wonder
        </div>
        <div>
          That flow'd like a long silver rivulet under
        </div>
        <div>
          The long fenny grass,&mdash;with so lovely a breast,
        </div>
        <div>
          Could it be a snake-tail made the charm of the rest?
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          So I roamed in that circle of horrors, and Fear
        </div>
        <div>
          Walk'd with me, by hills, and in valleys, and near
        </div>
        <div>
          Cluster'd trees for their gloom&mdash;not to shelter from
          heat&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          But lest a brute-shadow should grow at my feet;
        </div>
        <div>
          And besides that full oft in the sunshiny place
        </div>
        <div>
          Dark shadows would gather like clouds on its face,
        </div>
        <div>
          In the horrible likeness of demons (that none
        </div>
        <div>
          Could see, like invisible flames in the sun);
        </div>
        <div>
          But grew to one monster that seized on the light,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like the dragon that strangles the moon in the night;
        </div>
        <div>
          Fierce sphinxes, long serpents, and asps of the south;
        </div>
        <div>
          Wild birds of huge beak, and all horrors that drouth
        </div>
        <div>
          Engenders of slime in the land of the pest,
        </div>
        <div>
          Vile shapes without shape, and foul bats of the West,
        </div>
        <div>
          Bringing Night on their wings; and the bodies wherein
        </div>
        <div>
          Great Brahma imprisons the spirits of sin,
        </div>
        <div>
          Many-handed, that blent in one phantom of fight
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a Titan, and threatfully warr'd with the light;
        </div>
        <div>
          I have heard the wild shriek that gave signal to close,
        </div>
        <div>
          When they rushed on that shadowy Python of foes,
        </div>
        <div>
          That met with sharp beaks and wide gaping of jaws,
        </div>
        <div>
          With flappings of wings, and fierce grasping of claws,
        </div>
        <div>
          And whirls of long tails:&mdash;I have seen the quick flutter
        </div>
        <div>
          Of fragments dissevered,&mdash;and necks stretch'd to utter
        </div>
        <div>
          Long screamings of pain,&mdash;the swift motion of blows,
        </div>
        <div>
          And wrestling of arms&mdash;to the flight at the close,
        </div>
        <div>
          When the dust of the earth startled upward in rings,
        </div>
        <div>
          And flew on the whirlwind that follow'd their wings.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Thus they fled&mdash;not forgotten&mdash;but often to grow
        </div>
        <div>
          Like fears in my eyes, when I walk'd to and fro
        </div>
        <div>
          In the shadows, and felt from some beings unseen
        </div>
        <div>
          The warm touch of kisses, but clean or unclean
        </div>
        <div>
          I knew not, nor whether the love I had won
        </div>
        <div>
          Was of heaven or hell&mdash;till one day in the sun,
        </div>
        <div>
          In its very noon-blaze, I could fancy a thing
        </div>
        <div>
          Of beauty, but faint as the cloud-mirrors fling
        </div>
        <div>
          On the gaze of the shepherd that watches the sky,
        </div>
        <div>
          Half-seen and half-dream'd in the soul of his eye.
        </div>
        <div>
          And when in my musings I gazed on the stream,
        </div>
        <div>
          In motionless trances of thought, there would seem
        </div>
        <div>
          A face like that face, looking upward through mine:
        </div>
        <div>
          With his eyes full of love, and the dim-drownd shine
        </div>
        <div>
          Of limbs and fair garments, like clouds in that blue
        </div>
        <div>
          Serene:&mdash;there I stood for long hours but to view
        </div>
        <div>
          Those fond earnest eyes that were ever uplifted
        </div>
        <div>
          Towards me, and wink'd as the water-weed drifted
        </div>
        <div>
          Between; but the fish knew that presence, and plied
        </div>
        <div>
          Their long curvy tails, and swift darted aside.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          There I gazed for lost time, and forgot all the things
        </div>
        <div>
          That once had been wonders&mdash;the fishes with wings,
        </div>
        <div>
          And the glimmer of magnified eyes that look'd up
        </div>
        <div>
          From the glooms of the bottom like pearls in a cup,
        </div>
        <div>
          And the huge endless serpent of silvery gleam,
        </div>
        <div>
          Slow winding along like a tide in the stream.
        </div>
        <div>
          Some maid of the waters, some Naiad, methought
        </div>
        <div>
          Held me dear in the pearl of her eye&mdash;and I brought
        </div>
        <div>
          My wish to that fancy; and often I dash'd
        </div>
        <div>
          My limbs in the water, and suddenly splash'd
        </div>
        <div>
          The cool drops around me, yet clung to the brink,
        </div>
        <div>
          Chill'd by watery fears, how that beauty might sink
        </div>
        <div>
          With my life in her arms to her garden, and bind me
        </div>
        <div>
          With its long tangled grasses, or cruelly wind me
        </div>
        <div>
          In some eddy to hum out my life in her ear,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a spider-caught bee,&mdash;and in aid of that fear
        </div>
        <div>
          Came the tardy remembrance&mdash;Oh falsest of men!
        </div>
        <div>
          Why was not that beauty remember'd till then?
        </div>
        <div>
          My love, my safe love, whose glad life would have run
        </div>
        <div>
          Into mine&mdash;like a drop&mdash;that our fate might be one,
        </div>
        <div>
          That now, even now,&mdash;may-be,&mdash;clasp'd in a dream,
        </div>
        <div>
          That form which I gave to some jilt of the stream,
        </div>
        <div>
          And gazed with fond eyes that her tears tried to smother
        </div>
        <div>
          On a mock of those eyes that I gave to another!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Then I rose from the stream, but the eyes of my mind,
        </div>
        <div>
          Still full of the tempter, kept gazing behind
        </div>
        <div>
          On her crystalline face, while I painfully leapt
        </div>
        <div>
          To the bank, and shook off the curst waters, and wept
        </div>
        <div>
          With my brow in the reeds; and the reeds to my ear
        </div>
        <div>
          Bow'd, bent by no wind, and in whispers of fear,
        </div>
        <div>
          Growing small with large secrets, foretold me of one
        </div>
        <div>
          That loved me,&mdash;but oh to fly from her, and shun
        </div>
        <div>
          Her love like a pest&mdash;though her love was as true
        </div>
        <div>
          To mine as her stream to the heavenly blue;
        </div>
        <div>
          For why should I love her with love that would bring
        </div>
        <div>
          All misfortune, like hate, on so joyous a thing?
        </div>
        <div>
          Because of her rival,&mdash;even Her whose witch-face
        </div>
        <div>
          I had slighted, and therefore was doom'd in that place
        </div>
        <div>
          To roam, and had roam'd, where all horrors grew rank,
        </div>
        <div>
          Nine days ere I wept with my brow on that bank;
        </div>
        <div>
          Her name be not named, but her spite would not fail
        </div>
        <div>
          To our love like a blight; and they told me the tale
        </div>
        <div>
          Of Scylla,&mdash;and Picus, imprison'd to speak
        </div>
        <div>
          His shrill-screaming woe through a woodpecker's beak.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Then they ceased&mdash;I had heard as the voice of my star
        </div>
        <div>
          That told me the truth of my fortunes&mdash;thus far
        </div>
        <div>
          I had read of my sorrow, and lay in the hush
        </div>
        <div>
          Of deep meditation,&mdash;when lo! a light crush
        </div>
        <div>
          Of the reeds, and I turn'd and look'd round in the night
        </div>
        <div>
          Of new sunshine, and saw, as I sipp'd of the light
        </div>
        <div>
          Narrow-winking, the realized nymph of the stream,
        </div>
        <div>
          Rising up from the wave with the bend and the gleam
        </div>
        <div>
          Of a fountain, and o'er her white arms she kept throwing
        </div>
        <div>
          Bright torrents of hair, that went flowing and flowing
        </div>
        <div>
          In falls to her feet, and the blue waters roll'd
        </div>
        <div>
          Down her limbs like a garment, in many a fold,
        </div>
        <div>
          Sun-spangled, gold-broider'd, and fled far behind,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like an infinite train. So she came and reclined
        </div>
        <div>
          In the reeds, and I hunger'd to see her unseal
        </div>
        <div>
          The buds of her eyes that would ope and reveal
        </div>
        <div>
          The blue that was in them;&mdash;they oped and she raised
        </div>
        <div>
          Two orbs of pure crystal, and timidly gazed
        </div>
        <div>
          With her eyes on my eyes; but their color and shine
        </div>
        <div>
          Was of that which they look'd on, and mostly of mine&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          For she loved me,&mdash;except when she blush'd, and they
          sank,
        </div>
        <div>
          Shame-humbled, to number the stones on the bank,
        </div>
        <div>
          Or her play-idle fingers, while lisping she told me
        </div>
        <div>
          How she put on her veil, and in love to behold me
        </div>
        <div>
          Would wing through the sun till she fainted away
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a mist, and then flew to her waters and lay
        </div>
        <div>
          In love-patience long hours, and sore dazzled her eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          In watching for mine 'gainst the midsummer skies.
        </div>
        <div>
          But now they were heal'd,&mdash;O my heart, it still dances
        </div>
        <div>
          When I think of the charm of her changeable glances,
        </div>
        <div>
          And my image how small when it sank in the deep
        </div>
        <div>
          Of her eyes where her soul was,&mdash;Alas! now they weep,
        </div>
        <div>
          And none knoweth where. In what stream do her eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          Shed invisible tears? Who beholds where her sighs
        </div>
        <div>
          Flow in eddies, or sees the ascent of the leaf
        </div>
        <div>
          She has pluck'd with her tresses? Who listens her grief
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a far fall of waters, or hears where her feet
        </div>
        <div>
          Grow emphatic among the loose pebbles, and beat
        </div>
        <div>
          Them together? Ah! surely her flowers float adown
        </div>
        <div>
          To the sea unaccepted, and little ones drown
        </div>
        <div>
          For need of her mercy,&mdash;even he whose twin-brother
        </div>
        <div>
          Will miss him forever; and the sorrowful mother
        </div>
        <div>
          Imploreth in vain for his body to kiss
        </div>
        <div>
          And cling to, all dripping and cold as it is,
        </div>
        <div>
          Because that soft pity is lost in hard pain
        </div>
        <div>
          We loved,&mdash;how we loved!&mdash;for I thought not again
        </div>
        <div>
          Of the woes that were whisper'd like fears in that place
        </div>
        <div>
          If I gave me to beauty. Her face was the face,
        </div>
        <div>
          Far away, and her eyes were the eyes that were drown'd
        </div>
        <div>
          For my absence,&mdash;her arms were the arms that sought
          round
        </div>
        <div>
          And claspt me to nought; for I gazed and became
        </div>
        <div>
          Only true to my falsehood, and had but one name
        </div>
        <div>
          For two loves, and call'd ever on Ægle, sweet maid
        </div>
        <div>
          Of the sky-loving waters,&mdash;and was not afraid
        </div>
        <div>
          Of the sight of her skin;&mdash;for it never could be;
        </div>
        <div>
          Her beauty and love were misfortunes to me!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Thus our bliss had endured for a time-shorten'd space,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a day made of three, and the smile of her face
        </div>
        <div>
          Had been with me for joy,&mdash;when she told me indeed
        </div>
        <div>
          Her love was self-task'd with a work that would need
        </div>
        <div>
          Some short hours, for in truth 'twas the veriest pity
        </div>
        <div>
          Our love should not last, and then sang me a ditty,
        </div>
        <div>
          Of one with warm lips that should love her, and love her
        </div>
        <div>
          When suns were burnt dim and long ages past over.
        </div>
        <div>
          So she fled with her voice, and I patiently nested
        </div>
        <div>
          My limbs in the reeds, in still quiet, and rested
        </div>
        <div>
          Till my thoughts grew extinct, and I sank in a sleep
        </div>
        <div>
          Of dreams,&mdash;but their meaning was hidden too deep
        </div>
        <div>
          To be read what their woe was;&mdash;but still it was woe
        </div>
        <div>
          That was writ on all faces that swam to and fro
        </div>
        <div>
          In that river of night;&mdash;and the gaze of their eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          Was sad,&mdash;and the bend of their brows,&mdash;and their
          cries
        </div>
        <div>
          Were seen, but I heard not. The warm touch of tears
        </div>
        <div>
          Travell'd down my cold cheeks, and I shook till my fears
        </div>
        <div>
          Awaked me, and lo! I was couch'd in a bower,
        </div>
        <div>
          The growth of long summers rear'd up in an hour!
        </div>
        <div>
          Then I said, in the fear of my dream, I will fly
        </div>
        <div>
          From this magic, but could not, because that my eye
        </div>
        <div>
          Grew love-idle among the rich blooms; and the earth
        </div>
        <div>
          Held me down with its coolness of touch, and the mirth
        </div>
        <div>
          Of some bird was above me,&mdash;who, even in fear,
        </div>
        <div>
          Would startle the thrush? and methought there drew near
        </div>
        <div>
          A form as of Ægle,&mdash;but it was not the face
        </div>
        <div>
          Hope made, and I knew the witch-Queen of that place,
        </div>
        <div>
          Even Circe the Cruel, that came like a Death,
        </div>
        <div>
          Which I fear'd, and yet fled not, for want of my breath.
        </div>
        <div>
          There was thought in her face, and her eyes were not raised
        </div>
        <div>
          From the grass at her foot, but I saw, as I gazed,
        </div>
        <div>
          Her spite&mdash;and her countenance changed with her mind
        </div>
        <div>
          As she plann'd how to thrall me with beauty, and bind
        </div>
        <div>
          My soul to her charms,&mdash;and her long tresses play'd
        </div>
        <div>
          From shade into shine and from shine into shade,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a day in mid-autumn,&mdash;first fair, O how fair!
        </div>
        <div>
          With long snaky locks of the adder-black hair
        </div>
        <div>
          That clung round her neck,&mdash;those dark locks that I
          prize,
        </div>
        <div>
          For the sake of a maid that once loved me with eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          Of that fathomless hue,&mdash;but they changed as they
          roll'd,
        </div>
        <div>
          And brighten'd, and suddenly blazed into gold
        </div>
        <div>
          That she comb'd into flames, and the locks that fell down
        </div>
        <div>
          Turn'd dark as they fell, but I slighted their brown,
        </div>
        <div>
          Nor loved, till I saw the light ringlets shed wild,
        </div>
        <div>
          That innocence wears when she is but a child;
        </div>
        <div>
          And her eyes,&mdash;Oh I ne'er had been witched with their
          shine,
        </div>
        <div>
          Had they been any other, my Ægle, than thine!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Then I gave me to magic, and gazed till I madden'd
        </div>
        <div>
          In the full of their light,&mdash;but I sadden'd and sadden'd
        </div>
        <div>
          The deeper I look'd,&mdash;till I sank on the snow
        </div>
        <div>
          Of her bosom, a thing made of terror and woe,
        </div>
        <div>
          And answer'd its throb with the shudder of fears,
        </div>
        <div>
          And hid my cold eyes from her eyes with my tears,
        </div>
        <div>
          And strain'd her white arms with the still languid weight
        </div>
        <div>
          Of a fainting distress. There she sat like the Fate
        </div>
        <div>
          That is nurse unto Death, and bent over in shame
        </div>
        <div>
          To hide me from her the true Ægle&mdash;that came
        </div>
        <div>
          With the words on her lips the false witch had fore-given
        </div>
        <div>
          To make me immortal&mdash;for now I was even
        </div>
        <div>
          At the portals of Death, who but waited the hush
        </div>
        <div>
          Of world-sounds in my ears to cry welcome, and rush
        </div>
        <div>
          With my soul to the banks of his black-flowing river.
        </div>
        <div>
          Oh, would it had flown from my body forever,
        </div>
        <div>
          Ere I listen'd those words, when I felt with a start,
        </div>
        <div>
          The life-blood rush back in one throb to my heart,
        </div>
        <div>
          And saw the pale lips where the rest of that spell
        </div>
        <div>
          Had perished in horror&mdash;and heard the farewell
        </div>
        <div>
          Of that voice that was drown'd in the dash of the stream!
        </div>
        <div>
          How fain had I follow'd, and plunged with that scream
        </div>
        <div>
          Into death, but my being indignantly lagg'd
        </div>
        <div>
          Through the brutalized flesh that I painfully dragg'd
        </div>
        <div>
          Behind me:&mdash;O Circe! O mother of spite!
        </div>
        <div>
          Speak the last of that curse! and imprison me quite
        </div>
        <div>
          In the husk of a brute,&mdash;that no pity may name
        </div>
        <div>
          The man that I was,&mdash;that no kindred may claim&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          "The monster I am! Let me utterly be
        </div>
        <div>
          Brute-buried, and Nature's dishonor with me
        </div>
        <div>
          Uninscribed!"&mdash;But she listen'd my prayer, that was
          praise
        </div>
        <div>
          To her malice, with smiles, and advised me to gaze
        </div>
        <div>
          On the river for love,&mdash;and perchance she would make
        </div>
        <div>
          In pity a maid without eyes for my sake,
        </div>
        <div>
          And she left me like Scorn. Then I ask'd of the wave,
        </div>
        <div>
          What monster I was, and it trembled and gave
        </div>
        <div>
          The true shape of my grief, and I turn'd with my face
        </div>
        <div>
          From all waters forever, and fled through that place,
        </div>
        <div>
          Till with horror more strong than all magic I pass'd
        </div>
        <div>
          Its bounds, and the world was before me at last.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          There I wander'd in sorrow, and shunned the abodes
        </div>
        <div>
          Of men, that stood up in the likeness of Gods,
        </div>
        <div>
          But I saw from afar the warm shine of the sun
        </div>
        <div>
          On the cities, where man was a million, not one;
        </div>
        <div>
          And I saw the white smoke of their altars ascending,
        </div>
        <div>
          That show'd where the hearts of many were blending,
        </div>
        <div>
          And the wind in my face brought shrill voices that came
        </div>
        <div>
          From the trumpets that gather'd whole bands in one fame
        </div>
        <div>
          As a chorus of man,&mdash;and they stream'd from the gates
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a dusky libation poured out to the Fates.
        </div>
        <div>
          But at times there were gentler processions of peace
        </div>
        <div>
          That I watch'd with my soul in my eyes till their cease,
        </div>
        <div>
          There were women! there men! but to me a third sex
        </div>
        <div>
          I saw them all dots&mdash;yet I loved them as specks:
        </div>
        <div>
          And oft to assuage a sad yearning of eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          I stole near the city, but stole covert-wise
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a wild beast of love, and perchance to be smitten
        </div>
        <div>
          By some hand that I rather had wept on than bitten!
        </div>
        <div>
          Oh, I once had a haunt near a cot where a mother
        </div>
        <div>
          Daily sat in the shade with her child, and would smother
        </div>
        <div>
          Its eyelids in kisses, and then in its sleep
        </div>
        <div>
          Sang dreams in its ear of its manhood, while deep
        </div>
        <div>
          In a thicket of willows I gazed o'er the brooks
        </div>
        <div>
          That murmur'd between us and kiss'd them with looks;
        </div>
        <div>
          But the willows unbosom'd their secret, and never
        </div>
        <div>
          I return'd to a spot I had startled forever,
        </div>
        <div>
          Though I oft long'd to know, but could ask it of none,
        </div>
        <div>
          Was the mother still fair, and how big was her son?
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          For the haunters of fields they all shunn'd me by flight;
        </div>
        <div>
          The men in their horror, the women in fright;
        </div>
        <div>
          None ever remain'd save a child once that sported

          Among the wild bluebells, and playfully courted
        </div>
        <div>
          The breeze; and beside him a speckled snake lay
        </div>
        <div>
          Tight strangled, because it had hiss'd him away
        </div>
        <div>
          From the flower at his finger; he rose and drew near
        </div>
        <div>
          Like a Son of Immortals, one born to no fear,
        </div>
        <div>
          But with strength of black locks and with eyes azure bright
        </div>
        <div>
          To grow to large manhood of merciful might.
        </div>
        <div>
          He came, with his face of bold wonder, to feel,
        </div>
        <div>
          The hair of my side, and to lift up my heel,
        </div>
        <div>
          And question'd my face with wide eyes; but when under
        </div>
        <div>
          My lids he saw tears,&mdash;for I wept at his wonder,
        </div>
        <div>
          He stroked me, and utter'd such kindliness then,
        </div>
        <div>
          That the once love of women, the friendship of men
        </div>
        <div>
          In past sorrow, no kindness e'er came like a kiss
        </div>
        <div>
          On my heart in its desolate day such as this!
        </div>
        <div>
          And I yearn'd at his cheeks in my love, and down bent,
        </div>
        <div>
          And lifted him up in my arms with intent
        </div>
        <div>
          To kiss him,&mdash;but he cruel-kindly, alas!
        </div>
        <div>
          Held out to my lips a pluck'd handful of grass!
        </div>
        <div>
          Then I dropt him in horror, but felt as I fled
        </div>
        <div>
          The stone he indignantly hurl'd at my head,
        </div>
        <div>
          That dissever'd my ear,&mdash;but I felt not, whose fate
        </div>
        <div>
          Was to meet more distress in his love that his hate!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Thus I wander'd, companion'd of grief and forlorn
        </div>
        <div>
          Till I wish'd for that land where my being was born
        </div>
        <div>
          But what was that land with its love, where my home
        </div>
        <div>
          Was self-shut against me; for why should I come
        </div>
        <div>
          Like an after-distress to my gray-bearded father,
        </div>
        <div>
          With a blight to the last of his sight?&mdash;let him rather
        </div>
        <div>
          Lament for me dead, and shed tears in the urn
        </div>
        <div>
          Where I was not, and still in fond memory turn
        </div>
        <div>
          To his son even such as he left him. Oh, how
        </div>
        <div>
          Could I walk with the youth once my fellows, but now
        </div>
        <div>
          Like Gods to my humbled estate?&mdash;or how bear
        </div>
        <div>
          The steeds once the pride of my eyes and the care
        </div>
        <div>
          Of my hands? Then I turn'd me self-banish'd, and came
        </div>
        <div>
          Into Thessaly here, where I met with the same
        </div>
        <div>
          As myself. I have heard how they met by a stream
        </div>
        <div>
          In games, and were suddenly changed by a scream
        </div>
        <div>
          That made wretches of many, as she roll'd her wild eyes
        </div>
        <div>
          Against heaven, and so vanish'd.&mdash;The gentle and wise
        </div>
        <div>
          Lose their thoughts in deep studies, and others their ill
        </div>
        <div>
          In the mirth of mankind where they mingle them still.

          Neglectful pride, and cankering scorn,

    </h4>
    <h5>
      TO THE EDITOR OF THE <i>ATHENÆUM</i>.
    </h5>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR&mdash;The following Ode was written anticipating the
      tone of some strictures on my writings by the gentleman to whom
      it is addressed. I have not seen his book; but I know by hearsay
      that some of my verses are characterized as "profaneness and
      ribaldry"&mdash;citing, in proof, the description of a certain
      sow, from whose jaw a cabbage sprout
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">
          "Protruded, as the dove so staunch
        </div>
        <div class="i3">
          For peace supports an olive branch."
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      If the printed works of my Censor had not prepared me for any
      misapplication of <i>types</i>, I should have been surprised by
      this misapprehension of one of the commonest emblems. In some
      cases the dove unquestionably stands for the Divine Spirit; but
      the same bird is also a lay representative of the peace of this
      world, and, as such, has figured time out of mind in allegorical
      pictures. The sense in which it was used by me is plain from the
      context; at least, it would be plain to any one but a fisher for
      faults, predisposed to carp at some things, to dab at others, and
      to flounder in all. But I am possibly in error. It is the female
      swine, perhaps, that is profaned in the eyes of the Oriental
      tourist. Men find strange ways of marking their intolerance; and
      the spirit is certainly strong enough, in Mr. W.'s works, to set
      up a creature as sacred, in sheer opposition to the Mussulman,
      with whom she is a beast of abomination. It would only be going
      the whole sow.&mdash;I am, dear Sir, yours very truly, THOS.
      HOOD.

        <div>
          Where tears are falling while the bell is knelling,

          All things the horrid tenor of the sound

      Striding in the Steps of Strutt&mdash;The historian of the old

      endeavored to record a yearly revel, already fast hastening to
      decay. The Easter phase will soon be numbered with the pastimes
      of past times: its dogs will have had their day, and its Deer
      will be Fallow. A few more seasons, and this City Common Hunt
      will become uncommon.

          The wondrous topic of the curious swarm

          I'll blow it up, and not be set a coughin in this fashion!

        <div>
          Well down she takes my master's horn&mdash;I mean his horn
          for loading,
        </div>
        <div>
          And empties every grain alive for to set the flue exploding.
        </div>
        <div>
          Lawk, Mrs. Round! says I, and stares, that quantum is
          unproper,
        </div>
        <div>
          I'm sartin sure it can't not take a pound to sky a copper;

          You'll powder both our heads off, so I tells you, with its

        <div>
          But she only dried her fingers, and she takes a pinch of
          snuff.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, when the pinch is over&mdash;'Teach your Grandmother to
          suck

        <div>
          A powder horn,' says she&mdash;Well, says I, I wish you luck.

        <div>
          Them words sets up her back, so with her hands upon her hips,
        </div>
        <div>
          'Come,' says she, quite in a huff, 'come, keep your tongue
          inside your lips;

        <div>
          Afore ever you was born, I was well used to things like

          I shall put it in the grate, and let it burn up by degrees.

        <div>
          So in it goes, and Bounce&mdash;O Lord! it gives us such a

        <div>
          I thought we both were cannonized, like Sogers in a battle!

        <div>
          Up goes the copper like a squib, and us on both our backs,
        </div>
        <div>
          And bless the tubs, they bundled off, and split all into
          cracks.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, there I fainted dead away, and might have been cut
          shorter,
        </div>
        <div>
          But Providence was kind, and brought me to with scalding
          water.
        </div>
        <div>
          I first looks round for Mrs. Round, and sees her at a
          distance,
        </div>
        <div>
          As stiff as starch, and looked as dead as any thing in
          existence;
        </div>
        <div>
          All scorched and grimed, and more than that, I sees the
          copper slap
        </div>
        <div>
          Right on her head, for all the world like a percussion copper
          cap.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, I crooks her little fingers, and crumps them well up
          together,
        </div>
        <div>
          As humanity pints out, and burnt her nostrums with a feather;
        </div>
        <div>
          But for all as I can do, to restore her to her mortality,
        </div>
        <div>
          She never gives a sign of a return to sensuality.
        </div>
        <div>
          Thinks I, well there she lies, as dead as my own late
          departed mother,
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, she'll wash no more in this world, whatever she does in
          t'other.
        </div>
        <div>
          So I gives myself to scramble up the linens for a minute,
        </div>
        <div>
          Lawk, sich a shirt! thinks I, it's well my master wasn't in
          it;
        </div>
        <div>
          Oh! I never, never, never, never, never, see a sight so
          shockin;
        </div>
        <div>
          Here lays a leg, and there a leg&mdash;I mean, you know, a
          stocking&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Bodies all slit and torn to rags, and many a tattered skirt,
        </div>
        <div>
          And arms burnt off, and sides and backs all scotched and
          black with dirt;
        </div>
        <div>
          But as nobody was in 'em&mdash;none but&mdash;nobody was
          hurt!
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, there I am, a-scrambling up the things, all in a lump,
        </div>
        <div>
          When, mercy on us! such a groan as makes my heart to jump.
        </div>
        <div>
          And there she is, a-lying with a crazy sort of eye,
        </div>
        <div>
          A-staring at the wash-house roof, laid open to the sky:
        </div>
        <div>
          Then she beckons with a finger, and so down to her I reaches,
        </div>
        <div>
          And puts my ear agin her mouth to hear her dying speeches,
        </div>
        <div>
          For, poor soul! she has a husband and young orphans, as I
          knew;
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, Ma'am, you won't believe it, but it's Gospel fact and
          true,
        </div>
        <div>

        <div>
          On benches stood, to inspect the high ones,

          Alas! amidst her inquisition,

        <div>
          Fate brought her to a sad condition;

        <div>
          But I know well what it is, and why&mdash;they're jealous of
          David's fame,

        <div>
          But to vent it on the Cow, poor thing, is a cruelty and a
          shame,&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Do you think it might hang by and by, if you cannot hang it

          David has made a party up, to come and see his Cow

        <div>
          Why can't it hang up, turn about, with that picture of Mr.
          Turner's?
        </div>
        <div>
          Or do you think from Mr. Etty you need apprehend a row,
        </div>
        <div>
          If now and then you cut him down to hang up David's Cow!
        </div>
        <div>
          I can't think where their tastes have been, to not have such
          a creature,

        <div>
          Although I say, that should not say, it was prettier than

          It must be hung&mdash;and shall be hung&mdash;for, Mr.

        <div>
          I daren't take home the catalogue, unless it's got the Cow!
        </div>
        <div>
          As we only want it to be seen, I should not so much care,
        </div>
        <div>
          If it was only round the stone man's neck, a coming up the
          stair.
        </div>
        <div>
          Or down there in the marble room where all the figures stand,

        <div>
          Where one of them three Graces might just hold it in her
          hand&mdash;

        <div>
          Or maybe Baily's Charity the favor would allow,
        </div>
        <div>
          It would really be a charity to hang up David's Cow.
        </div>
        <div>
          We haven't nowhere else to go if you don't hang it here,

          The Water Color place allows no oilman to appear&mdash;

          Douw,
        </div>
        <div>
          And the Suffolk Gallery will not do&mdash;it's not a Suffolk
          Cow:
        </div>
        <div>
          I wish you'd seen him painting her, he hardly took his meals
        </div>
        <div>
          Till she was painted on the board, correct from head to
          heels:
        </div>
        <div>
          His heart and soul was in his Cow, and almost made him
          shabby,
        </div>
        <div>
          He hardly whipped the boys at all,&mdash;or helped to nurse
          the babby,
        </div>
        <div>
          And when he had her all complete and painted over red,
        </div>
        <div>
          He got so grand, I really thought him going off his head.
        </div>
        <div>
          Now hang it, Mr. Hilton, do just hang it anyhow,
        </div>
        <div>
          Poor David, he will hang himself, unless you hang his Cow.

        <div>
          And if it's inconvenient and drawn too big by half&mdash;

        <div>
          Only some horse, or pig, or cow, or great jackass, is sure to
          come and stand right before the wicket.
        </div>
        <div>
          There's fifty-five private houses, let alone barns and
          workshops, and pigsties, and poultry huts, and such-like
          sheds,
        </div>
        <div>
          With plenty of public-houses&mdash;two Foxes, one Green Man,
          three Bunch of Grapes, one Crown, and six King's Heads.
        </div>
        <div>
          The Green Man is reckoned the best, as the only one that for
          love or money can raise
        </div>
        <div>
          A postillion, a blue jacket, two deplorable lame white
          horses, and a ramshackle "neat post-chaise!"
        </div>
        <div>
          There's one parish church for all the people, whatsoever may
          be their ranks in life or their degrees,
        </div>
        <div>
          Except one very damp, small, dark, freezing cold, a little
          Methodist Chapel of Ease;
        </div>
        <div>
          And close by the churchyard, there's a stone-mason's yard,
          that when the time is seasonable
        </div>
        <div>
          Will furnish with afflictions sore and marble urns and
          cherubims, very low and reasonable.
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a cage, comfortable enough; I've been in it with Old
          Jack Jeffery and Tom Pike;
        </div>
        <div>
          For the Green Man next door will send you in ale, gin, or
          anything else you like.
        </div>
        <div>
          I can't speak of the stocks, as nothing remains of them but
          the upright post;
        </div>
        <div>
          But the pound is kept in repair for the sake of Cob's horse
          as is always there almost.
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a smithy of course, where that queer sort of a chap
          in his way, Old Joe Bradley,
        </div>
        <div>
          Perpetually hammers and stammers, for he stutters and shoes
          horses very badly.
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a shop of all sorts that sells everything, kept by
          the widow of Mr. Task;
        </div>
        <div>
          But when you go there it's ten to one she's out of everything
          you ask.
        </div>
        <div>
          You'll know her house by the swarm of boys, like flies, about
          the old sugary cask:
        </div>
        <div>
          There are six empty houses, and not so well papered inside as
          out,
        </div>
        <div>
          For bill-stickers won't beware, but stick notices of sales
          and election placards all about.
        </div>
        <div>
          That's the Doctor's with a green door, where the garden pots
          in the window is seen;
        </div>
        <div>
          A weakly monthly rose that don't blow, and a red geranium,
          and a teaplant with five black leaves, and one green.
        </div>
        <div>
          As for hollyhocks at the cottage doors, and honeysuckles and
          jasmines, you may go and whistle;
        </div>
        <div>
          But the Tailor's front garden grows two cabbages, a dock, a
          ha'porth of pennyroyal, two dandelions, and a thistle!
        </div>
        <div>
          There are three small orchards&mdash;Mr. Busby's the
          school-master's is the chief&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          With two pear trees that don't bear; one plum, and an apple
          that every year is stripped by a thief.
        </div>
        <div>
          There's another small day-school too, kept by the respectable
          Mrs. Gaby,
        </div>
        <div>
          A select establishment for six little boys, and one big, and
          four little girls and a baby;
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a rectory with pointed gables and strange odd
          chimneys that never smokes,
        </div>
        <div>
          For the Rector don't live on his living like other Christian
          sort of folks;
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a barber's once a week well filled with rough
          black-bearded, shock-headed churls,
        </div>
        <div>
          And a window with two feminine men's heads, and two masculine
          ladies in false curls;
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a butcher's, and a carpenter's, and a plumber's, and
          a small greengrocer's, and a baker,
        </div>
        <div>
          But he won't bake on a Sunday; and there's a sexton that's a
          coal merchant besides, and an undertaker;
        </div>
        <div>
          And a toyshop, but not a whole one, for a village can't
          compare with the London shops;
        </div>
        <div>
          One window sells drums, dolls, kites, carts, bats, Clout's
          balls, and the other sells malt and hops,
        </div>
        <div>
          And Mrs. Brown in domestic economy not to be a bit behind her
          betters,
        </div>
        <div>
          Lets her house to a milliner, a watchmaker, a rat-catcher, a
          cobbler, lives in it herself, and it's the post-office for
          letters.
        </div>
        <div>
          Now I've gone through all the village&mdash;ay, from end to
          end, save and except one more house,
        </div>
        <div>
          But I haven't come to that&mdash;and I hope I never
          shall&mdash;and that's the Village Poor House!

          Your friend Mr. Whitby,

        <div>
          Twelve sticks come attending

        <div>
          A stick of a Chairman,

        <div>
          A little dark spare man,

        <div>
          A cheque in the letter.

        <div>

          Mr. Roe will be grateful

          To send him a plateful;

          "Must trouble for tater";

        <div>

          With somebody&mdash;nine off;

        <div>
          Bucellas made handy,

          That's very hot&mdash;very!

        <div>
          You help Mr. Myrtle,

        <div>
          Then find your mock-turtle
        </div>
        <div>
          Went off while you lingered,
        </div>
        <div>
          With waiter light-fingered.
        </div>
        <div>
          To make up for gammon,
        </div>
        <div>
          You order some salmon,
        </div>
        <div>
          Which comes to your fauces,
        </div>
        <div>
          With boats without sauces.
        </div>
        <div>
          You then make a cut on
        </div>
        <div>
          Some lamb big as mutton;
        </div>
        <div>
          And ask for some grass too,
        </div>
        <div>
          But that you must pass too;
        </div>
        <div>
          It served the first twenty,
        </div>
        <div>
          But toast there is plenty.
        </div>
        <div>
          Then, while lamb gets coldish,
        </div>
        <div>
          A goose that is oldish&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          At carving not clever&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          You're begged to dissever,
        </div>
        <div>
          And when you thus treat it,
        </div>
        <div>
          Find no one will eat it.
        </div>
        <div>
          So, hungry as glutton,
        </div>
        <div>
          You turn to your mutton,
        </div>
        <div>
          But&mdash;no sight for laughter&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          The soup it's gone after.
        </div>
        <div>
          Mr. Green then is very
        </div>
        <div>
          Disposed to take Sherry;
        </div>
        <div>
          And then Mr. Nappy
        </div>
        <div>
          Will feel very happy;
        </div>
        <div>
          And then Mr. Conner
        </div>
        <div>
          Requests the same honor;
        </div>
        <div>
          Mr. Clark, when at leisure,
        </div>
        <div>
          Will really feel pleasure;
        </div>
        <div>
          Then waiter leans over
        </div>
        <div>
          To take off a cover
        </div>
        <div>
          From fowls, which all beg of,
        </div>
        <div>
          A wing or a leg of;
        </div>
        <div>
          And while they all peck bone,
        </div>
        <div>
          You take to a neck-bone,
        </div>
        <div>
          But even your hunger
        </div>
        <div>
          Declares for a younger.
        </div>
        <div>
          A fresh plate you call for,
        </div>
        <div>
          But vainly you bawl for;
        </div>
        <div>
          Now taste disapproves it,
        </div>
        <div>
          No waiter removes it.

        <div>
          Still hope, newly budding,

        <div>
          Relies on a pudding;

        <div>
          But critics each minute
        </div>
        <div>
          Set fancy agin it&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          "That's queer Vermicelli."
        </div>
        <div>
          "I say, Vizetelly,
        </div>
        <div>
          There's glue in that jelly."
        </div>
        <div>
          "Tarts bad altogether;
        </div>
        <div>
          That crust's made of leather."
        </div>
        <div>
          "Some custard, friend Vesey?"
        </div>
        <div>
          "No&mdash;batter made easy."
        </div>
        <div>
          "Some cheese, Mr. Foster?"

        <div>
          "&mdash;Don't like single Glo'ster."
        </div>
        <div>
          Meanwhile, to top table,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like fox in the fable,
        </div>
        <div>
          You see silver dishes,
        </div>
        <div>
          With those little fishes,
        </div>
        <div>
          The whitebait delicious,

        <div>
          Borne past you officious;
        </div>
        <div>
          And hear rather plainish
        </div>
        <div>
          A sound that's champagnish,
        </div>
        <div>
          And glimpse certain bottles
        </div>
        <div>
          Made long in the throttles;
        </div>
        <div>
          And sniff&mdash;very pleasant!
        </div>
        <div>
          Grouse, partridge, and pheasant.
        </div>
        <div>
          And see mounds of ices

          One day, as I was going by

          That part of Holborn christened High,
        </div>
        <div>
          I heard a loud and sodden cry,

          That chill'd my very blood;

        <div>
          Where pigs and Irish wont to rally,

        <div>
          With streaming hair and heaving breast,
        </div>
        <div>
          As one stark mad with grief.

          One morning, ere my usual time
        </div>
        <div>
          I rose, about the seventh chime,
        </div>
        <div>
          When little stunted boys that climb
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          Still linger in the street;
        </div>
        <div>
          And as I walked, I saw indeed
        </div>
        <div>
          A sample of the sooty breed,
        </div>
        <div>
          Though he was rather run to seed,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          In height above five feet.
        </div>
        <div>
          A mongrel tint he seemed to take,
        </div>
        <div>
          Poetic simile to make,
        </div>
        <div>
          DAY through his MARTIN 'gan to break,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          White overcoming jet.
        </div>
        <div>
          From side to side he crossed oblique,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like Frenchman who has friends to seek,
        </div>
        <div>
          And yet no English word can speak,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          He walked upon the fret:
        </div>
        <div>
          And while he sought the dingy job
        </div>
        <div>
          His lab'ring breast appeared to throb,
        </div>
        <div>
          And half a hiccup half a sob
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          Betray'd internal woe.
        </div>
        <div>
          To cry amain he had by rote
        </div>
        <div>
          He yearn'd, but law forbade the note,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like Chanticleer with roupy throat,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          He gaped&mdash;but not a crow!
        </div>
        <div>
          I watched him and the glimpse I snatched
        </div>
        <div>
          Disclosed his sorry eyelids patch'd
        </div>
        <div>
          With red, as if the soot had catch'd
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          That hung about the lid;
        </div>
        <div>
          And soon I saw the tear-drop stray,

        <div>
          He did not care to brush away;
        </div>
        <div>
          Thought I, the cause he will betray&mdash;
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          And thus at last he did.

      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Well, here's a pretty go! here's a Gagging Act, if ever there
          was a gagging!
        </div>
        <div>
          But I'm bound the members as silenced us, in doing it had
          plenty of magging.
        </div>
        <div>
          They had better send us all off, they had, to the School for
          the Deaf and Dumb,
        </div>
        <div>
          To unlarn us our mother tongues, and to make signs and be
          regularly mum.
        </div>
        <div>
          But they can't undo natur&mdash;as sure as ever the morning
          begins to peep,
        </div>
        <div>
          Directly I open my eyes, I can't help calling out Sweep
        </div>
        <div>
          As natural as the sparrows among the chimbley-pots, that say
          Cheep!
        </div>
        <div>
          For my own part I find my suppressed voice very uneasy,
        </div>
        <div>
          And comparable to nothing but having your tissue stopt when
          you are sneezy.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, it's all up with us! tho' I suppose we mustn't cry all
          up.
        </div>
        <div>
          Here's a precious merry Christmas, I'm blest if I can earn
          either bit or sup!
        </div>
        <div>
          If crying Sweep, of mornings, is going beyond quietness's
          border,
        </div>
        <div>
          Them as pretends to be fond of silence oughtn't to cry hear,
          hear, and order, order.
        </div>
        <div>
          I wonder Mr. Sutton, as we've sut-on too, don't sympathize
          with us
        </div>
        <div>
          As a Speaker what don't speak, and that's exactly our own
          cus.
        </div>
        <div>
          God help us if we don't not cry, how are we to pursue our
          callings?
        </div>
        <div>
          I'm sure we're not half so bad as other businesses with their
          bawlings.
        </div>
        <div>
          For instance, the general postmen, that at six o'clock go
          about ringing,
        </div>
        <div>
          And wake up all the babbies that their mothers have just got
          to sleep with singing.
        </div>
        <div>
          Greens oughtn't to be cried no more than blacks&mdash;to do
          the unpartial job,
        </div>
        <div>
          If they bring in a Sooty Bill, they ought to have brought in
          a Dusty Bob.
        </div>
        <div>
          Is a dustman's voice more sweet than ourn, when he comes a
          seeking arter the cinders,
        </div>
        <div>
          Instead of a little boy like a blackbird in spring, singing
          merrily under your windows?
        </div>
        <div>
          There's the omnibus cads as plies in Cheapside, and keeps
          calling out Bank and City;
        </div>
        <div>
          Let his Worship, the Mayor, decide if our call of Sweep is
          not just as pretty.
        </div>
        <div>
          I can't see why the Jews should be let go about crying Old
          Close thro' their hooky noses,
        </div>
        <div>
          And Christian laws should be ten times more hard than the old
          stone laws of Moses.
        </div>
        <div>
          Why isn't the mouths of the muffin-men compell'd to be
          equally shut?
        </div>
        <div>
          Why, because Parliament members eat muffins, but they never
          eat no sut.
        </div>
        <div>
          Next year there won't be any May-day at all, we shan't have
          no heart to dance,
        </div>
        <div>
          And Jack in the Green will go in black like mourning for our
          mischance;
        </div>
        <div>
          If we live as long as May, that's to say, through the hard
          winter and pinching weather,
        </div>
        <div>
          For I don't see how we're to earn enough to keep body and
          soul together.
        </div>
        <div>
          I only wish Mr. Wilberforce, or some of them that pities the
          niggers,
        </div>
        <div>
          Would take a peep down in our cellars, and look at our
          miserable starving figures,
        </div>
        <div>
          A-sitting idle on our empty sacks, and all ready to eat each
          other,
        </div>
        <div>
          And a brood of little ones crying for bread to a
          heartbreaking Father and Mother.
        </div>
        <div>
          They havn't a rag of clothes to mend, if their mothers had
          thread and needles,
        </div>
        <div>
          But crawl naked about the cellars, poor things, like a swarm
          of common black beadles.
        </div>
        <div>
          If they'd only inquired before passing the Act, and taken a
          few such peeps,
        </div>
        <div>
          I don't think that any real gentleman would have set his face
          against sweeps.
        </div>
        <div>
          Climbing's an ancient respectable art, and if History's of
          any vally,
        </div>
        <div>
          Was recommended by Queen Elizabeth to the great Sir Walter
          Raleigh,
        </div>
        <div>
          When he wrote on a pane of glass how I'd climb, if the way I
          only knew,
        </div>
        <div>
          And she writ beneath, if your heart's afeard, don't venture
          up the flue.
        </div>
        <div>
          As for me I was always loyal, and respected all powers that
          are higher,
        </div>
        <div>
          But how can I now say God save the King, if I ain't to be a
          Cryer?
        </div>
        <div>
          There's London milk, that's one of the cries, even on Sunday
          the law allows,
        </div>
        <div>
          But ought black sweeps, that are human beasts, to be worser
          off than black cows?
        </div>
        <div>
          Do <i>we</i> go calling about, when it's church time, like
          the noisy Billingsgate vermin,
        </div>
        <div>
          And disturb the parson with "All alive O!" in the middle of a
          funeral sermon?
        </div>
        <div>
          But the fish won't keep, not the mackerel won't, is the cry
          of the Parliament elves,
        </div>
        <div>
          Everything, except the sweeps I think, is to be allowed to
          keep themselves!
        </div>
        <div>
          Lord help us! what's to become of us if we mustn't cry no
          more?
        </div>
        <div>
          We shan't do for black mutes to go a standing at a death's
          door.
        </div>
        <div>
          And we shan't do to emigrate, no not even to the Hottentot
          nations,
        </div>
        <div>
          For as time wears on, our black will wear off, and then think
          of our situations!
        </div>
        <div>
          And we should not do, in lieu of black-a-moor footmen, to
          serve ladies of quality nimbly,
        </div>
        <div>
          For when we were drest in our sky-blue and silver, and large
          frills, all clean and neat, and white silk stockings, if they
          pleased to desire us to sweep the hearth, we couldn't resist
          the chimbley.

          The turban on her head was white as any driven snow;

        <div>
          A purple bandalette past o'er the lofty brow below,
        </div>
        <div>
          And thence upon her shoulders fell, by either jewell'd ear;

          In yellow folds voluminous she wore her long cachemere;

          Enveloped her in drapery the color of new milk;

          Yet oft it floated wide in front, disclosing underneath

          A gorgeous Persian tunic, rich with many a broider'd wreath,

          The reverence due to loveliness, to rank, or ancient birth,

          They blew the breath impetuous, and panting from the race.

        <div>
          Well, the country's a pleasant place, sure enough, for people
          that's country born,
        </div>
        <div>
          And useful, no doubt, in a natural way, for growing our grass
          and our corn.
        </div>
        <div>
          It was kindly meant of my cousin Giles, to write and invite
          me down,
        </div>
        <div>
          Tho' as yet all I've seen of a pastoral life only makes one
          more partial to town.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          At first I thought I was really come down into all sorts of
          rural bliss,
        </div>
        <div>
          For Porkington Place, with its cows and its pigs, and its
          poultry, looks not much amiss;
        </div>
        <div>
          There's something about a dairy farm, with its different
          kinds of live stock,
        </div>
        <div>
          That puts one in mind of Paradise, and Adam and his innocent
          flock;
        </div>
        <div>
          But somehow the good old Elysium fields have not been well
          handed down,
        </div>
        <div>
          And as yet I have found no fields to prefer to dear Leicester
          Fields up in town.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          To be sure it is pleasant to walk in the meads, and so I
          should like for miles,
        </div>
        <div>
          If it wasn't for clodpoles of carpenters that put up such
          crooked stiles;
        </div>
        <div>
          For the bars jut out, and you must jut out, till you're
          almost broken in two,
        </div>
        <div>
          If you clamber you're certain sure of a fall, and you stick
          if you try to creep through.
        </div>
        <div>
          Of course, in the end, one learns how to climb without
          constant tumbles down,
        </div>
        <div>
          But still as to walking so stylishly, it's pleasanter done
          about town.
        </div>
        <div>
          There's a way, I know, to avoid the stiles, and that's by a
          walk in a lane,
        </div>
        <div>
          And I did find a very nice shady one, but I never dared go
          again;
        </div>
        <div>
          For who should I meet but a rampaging bull, that wouldn't be
          kept in the pound,
        </div>
        <div>
          A trying to toss the whole world at once, by sticking his
          horns in the ground?
        </div>
        <div>
          And that, by the bye, is another thing, that pulls rural
          pleasures down,
        </div>
        <div>
          Ev'ry day in the country is cattle-day, and there's only two
          up in town.
        </div>
        <div>
          Then I've rose with the sun, to go brushing away at the first
          early pearly dew,
        </div>
        <div>
          And to meet Aurory, or whatever's her name, and I always got
          wetted through;
        </div>
        <div>
          My shoes are like sops, and I caught a bad cold, and a nice
          draggle-tail to my gown,
        </div>
        <div>
          That's not the way that we bathe our feet, or wear our
          pearls, up in town!
        </div>
        <div>
          As for picking flow'rs, I have tried at a hedge, sweet
          eglantine roses to snatch,
        </div>
        <div>
          But, mercy on us! how nettles will sting, and how the long
          brambles do scratch;
        </div>
        <div>
          Besides hitching my hat on a nasty thorn that tore all the
          bows from the crown,
        </div>
        <div>
          One may walk long enough without hats branching off, or
          losing one's bows about town.
        </div>
        <div>
          But worse than that, in a long rural walk, suppose that it
          blows up for rain,
        </div>
        <div>
          And all at once you discover yourself in a real St. Swithin's
          Lane;
        </div>
        <div>
          And while you're running all ducked and drown'd, and pelted
          with sixpenny drops,
        </div>
        <div>
          "Fine weather," you hear the farmers say; "a nice growing
          show'r for the crops!"
        </div>
        <div>
          But who's to crop me another new hat, or grow me another new
          gown?
        </div>
        <div>
          For you can't take a shilling fare with a plough as you do
          with the hackneys in town.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          Then my nevys too, they must drag me off to go with them
          gathering nuts,
        </div>
        <div>
          And we always set out by the longest way and return by the
          shortest cuts.
        </div>
        <div>
          Short cuts, indeed! But it's nuts to them, to get a poor
          lustyish aunt
        </div>
        <div>
          To scramble through gaps or jump over a ditch, when they're
          morally certain she can't,&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          For whenever I get in some awkward scrape, and it's almost
          daily the case,
        </div>
        <div>
          Tho' they don't laugh out, the mischievous brats, I see the
          hooray! in their face.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          There's the other day, for my sight is short, and I saw what
          was green beyond,
        </div>
        <div>
          And thought it was all terry firmer and grass till I walked
          in the duckweed pond:
        </div>
        <div>
          Or perhaps when I've pully-hauled up a bank they see me come
          launching down,
        </div>
        <div>
          As none but a stout London female can do as is come a first
          time out of town.
        </div>
        <div>
          Then how sweet, some say, on a mossy bank a verdurous seat to
          find,
        </div>
        <div>
          But for my part I always found it a joy that brought a
          repentance behind;
        </div>
        <div>
          For the juicy grass with its nasty green has stained a whole
          breadth of my gown&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          And when gowns are dyed, I needn't say, it's much better done
          up in town.
        </div>
        <div>
          As for country fare, the first morning I came I heard such a
          shrill piece of work!
        </div>
        <div>
          And ever since&mdash;and it's ten days ago&mdash;we've lived
          upon nothing but pork;
        </div>
        <div>
          One Sunday except, and then I turn'd sick, a plague take all
          countrified cooks!
        </div>
        <div>
          Why didn't they tell me, <i>before</i> I had dined, they made
          pigeon pies of the rooks?
        </div>
        <div>
          Then the gooseberry wine, tho' it's pleasant when up, it
          doesn't agree when it's down,
        </div>
        <div>
          But it served me right like a gooseberry fool to look for
          champagne out of town!
        </div>
        <div>
          To be sure cousin G. meant it all for the best when he
          started this pastoral plan,
        </div>
        <div>
          And his wife is a worthy domestical soul and she teaches me
          all that she can,
        </div>
        <div>
          Such as making of cheese, and curing of hams, but I'm sure
          that I never shall learn,
        </div>
        <div>
          And I've fetched more back-ache than butter as yet by
          chumping away at the churn;
        </div>
        <div>
          But in making hay, tho' it's tanning work, I found it more
          easy to make,
        </div>
        <div>
          But it tries one's legs, and no great relief when you're
          tired to sit down on the rake.
        </div>
        <div>
          I'd a country dance too at harvest home, with a regular
          country clown,
        </div>
        <div>
          But, Lord! they don't hug one round the waist and give one
          such smacks in town!
        </div>
        <div>
          Then I've tried to make friends with the birds and the
          beasts, but they take to such curious rigs,
        </div>
        <div>
          I'm always at odds with the turkey-cock, and I can't even
          please the pigs.
        </div>
        <div>
          The very hens pick holes in my hands when I grope for the
          new-laid eggs,
        </div>
        <div>
          And the gander comes hissing out of the pond on purpose to
          flap at my legs.
        </div>
        <div>
          I've been bump'd in a ditch by the cow without horns, and the
          old sow trampled me down,
        </div>
        <div>
          The beasts are as vicious as any wild beasts&mdash;but
          they're kept in cages in town!
        </div>
        <div>
          Another thing is the nasty dogs&mdash;thro' the village I
          hardly can stir

          barking cur;
        </div>
        <div>
          And now you would swear all the dogs in the place were set on
          to hunt me down,
        </div>
        <div>
          But neither the brutes nor the people I think are as civilly

          Last night about twelve I was scared broad awake, and all in
          a tremble of fright,
        </div>
        <div>
          But instead of a family murder it proved an owl that flies
          screeching at night.
        </div>
        <div>
          Then there's plenty of ricks and stacks all about, and I
          can't help dreaming of Swing&mdash;

          In short, I think that a plastoral life is not the most
          happiest thing;
        </div>
        <div>
          For besides all the troubles I've mentioned before as endur'd
          for rurality's sake,
        </div>
        <div>
          I've been stung by the bees, and I've set among ants, and
          once&mdash;ugh! I trod on a snake!
        </div>
        <div>
          And as to moskitoes they tortured me so, for I've got a
          particular skin,
        </div>
        <div>
          I do think it's the gnats coming out of the ponds that drives
          the poor suicides in!
        </div>
        <div>
          And after all an't there new-laid eggs to be had upon Holborn
          Hill?
        </div>
        <div>
          And dairy-fed pork in Broad St. Giles's, and fresh butter
          wherever you will?
        </div>
        <div>
          And a covered cart that brings Cottage Bread quite
          rustical-like and brown?
        </div>
        <div>
          So one isn't so very uncountrified in the very heart of the
          town.
        </div>
        <div>
          Howsomever my mind's made up, and although I'm sure cousin
          Giles will be vext,
        </div>
        <div>
          I mean to book me an inside place up to town upon Saturday
          next,
        </div>
        <div>
          And if nothing happens, soon after ten, I shall be at the Old
          Bell and Crown,
        </div>
        <div>
          And perhaps I may come to the country again, when London is
          all burnt down!

          One tooth he had with many fangs,

        <div>
          To pay the fee, and quite begrudged

          His moans and groans were truly shocking,

          And loud,&mdash;altho' he held his jaw.
        </div>
        <div>
          Many a tug he gave his gum

          At last, but after much debating,

          He joined a score of mouths in waiting,
        </div>
        <div>
          Like his, to have their troubles out.
        </div>
        <div>
          Sad sight it was to look about
        </div>
        <div>
          At twenty faces making faces,

        <div>
          With many a rampant trick and antic,

        <div>
          For all were very horrid cases,
        </div>
        <div>
          And made their owners nearly frantic.
        </div>
        <div>
          A little wicket now and then

        <div>
          Took one of these unhappy men,

          While eyes and mouth together gushed;
        </div>
        <div>
          At last arrived our hero's turn,

        <div>
          Who plunged his hands in both his pockets,
        </div>
        <div>
          And down he sat, prepared to learn
        </div>
        <div>
          How teeth are charmed to quit their sockets.

          The thread of old associations;

        <div>
          It had so many tender ties;

        <div>
          One cord seemed wrenching at his heart,
        </div>
        <div>
          And two were tugging at his eyes;
        </div>
        <div>
          "Bone of his bone," he felt, of course,

          As husbands do in such divorce;

        </div>
        <div>
          Went&mdash;where it used to send his victual!

          The monstrous pain of this proceeding

        <div>
          To save, at least, his purse from bleeding;
        </div>
        <div>
          So when the dentist sought his fees,
        </div>
        <div>
          Quoth Hunks, "Let's finish, if you please,"

          There stood his foeman, Mike Mahoney,

          A vagrant reaper, Irish born,

          A fact that Hunks remembered quickly;

          His whistle all at once was quelled,

          Resolved not yet to pay the debt,

          In words before he used the sickle;

        </div>
        <div>

          "What! Hunks again within my door!

        <div>
          I'll pull his nose"; quoth Hunks, "You cannot."

        <div>
          The doctor looked and saw the case

        <div>
          Plain as the nose <i>not</i> on his face.

          But then arose a long demur,

          The snubbing folks in this new fashion

        <div>

          Replaced as it was meant by nature;

          The doctor deemed and proved it too,

        <div>
          That noses from the nose will do

        <div>
          The part was bandaged up and muffled.

        <div>
          Good-Morning, Mr. What-d'ye-call! Well! here's another pretty
          job!
        </div>
        <div>
          Lord help my Lady!&mdash;what a smash!&mdash;if you had only
          heard her sob!
        </div>
        <div>
          It was all through Mr. Lambert: but for certain he was winey,
        </div>
        <div>
          To think for to go to sit down on a table full of Chiney.
        </div>
        <div>
          "Deuce take your stupid head!" says my Lady to his very face;
        </div>
        <div>
          But politeness, you know, is nothing when there's Chiney in
          the case;
        </div>
        <div>
          And if ever a woman was fond of Chiney to a passion,
        </div>
        <div>
          It's my mistress, and all sorts of it, whether new or old
          fashion.
        </div>
        <div>
          Her brother's a sea-captain, and brings her home
          shiploads&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          Such bronzes, and such dragons, and nasty squatting things
          like toads;
        </div>
        <div>
          And great nidnoddin' mandarins, with palsies in the head:
        </div>
        <div>
          I declare I've often dreamt of them, and had nightmares in my
          bed.
        </div>
        <div>
          But the frightfuller they are&mdash;lawk! she loves them all
          the better,
        </div>
        <div>
          She'd have Old Nick himself made of Chiney if they'd let her.
        </div>
        <div>
          Lawk-a-mercy! break her Chiney, and it's breaking her very
          heart;
        </div>
        <div>
          If I touched it, she would very soon say, "Mary, we must
          part."
        </div>
        <div>
          To be sure she is unlucky: only Friday comes Master Randall,
        </div>
        <div>
          And breaks a broken spout, and fresh chips a tea-cup handle:
        </div>
        <div>
          He's a dear, sweet little child, but he will so finger and
          touch,
        </div>
        <div>
          And that's why my Lady doesn't take to children much.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, there's stupid Mr. Lambert, with his two greatcoat
          flaps.
        </div>
        <div>
          Must go and sit down on the Dresd'n shepherdesses' laps,
        </div>
        <div>
          As if there was no such things as rosewood chairs in the
          room!
        </div>
        <div>
          I couldn't have made a greater sweep with the handle of the
          broom.
        </div>
        <div>
          Mercy on us! how my mistress began to rave and tear!
        </div>
        <div>
          Well, after all, there's nothing like good ironstone ware for
          wear.
        </div>
        <div>
          If ever I marry, that's flat, I'm sure it won't be John
          Dockery&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          I should be a wretched woman in a shop full of crockery.
        </div>
        <div>
          I should never like to wipe it, though I love to be neat and
          tidy,
        </div>
        <div>
          And afraid of meat on market-days every Monday and Friday
        </div>
        <div>
          I'm very much mistook if Mr. Lambert's will be a catch;
        </div>
        <div>
          The breaking the Chiney will be the breaking-off of his own
          match.
        </div>
        <div>
          Missis wouldn't have an angel, if he was careless about
          Chiney;
        </div>
        <div>
          She never forgives a chip, if it's ever so small and tiny.
        </div>
        <div>
          Lawk! I never saw a man in all my life in such a taking;
        </div>
        <div>
          I could find it in my heart to pity him for all his
          mischief-making.
        </div>
        <div>
          To see him stand a-hammering and stammering like a zany;
        </div>
        <div>
          But what signifies apologies, if they won't mend old Chaney!
        </div>
        <div>
          If he sent her up whole crates full, from Wedgwood's and Mr.
          Spode's,
        </div>
        <div>
          He couldn't make amends for the crack'd mandarins and smash'd
          toads.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well! every one has their tastes, but, for my part, my own
          self,
        </div>
        <div>
          I'd rather have the figures on my poor dear grandmother's old
          shelf
        </div>
        <div>
          A nice pea-green poll-parrot, and two reapers with brown ears
          of corns,
        </div>
        <div>
          And a shepherd with a crook after a lamb with two gilt horns,
        </div>
        <div>
          And such a Jemmy Jessamy in top-boots and sky-blue vest,
        </div>
        <div>
          And a frill and flower'd waistcoat, with a fine bow-pot at
          the breast.
        </div>
        <div>
          God help her, poor old soul! I shall come into 'em at her
          death;
        </div>
        <div>
          Though she's a hearty woman for her years, except her
          shortness of breath.
        </div>
        <div>
          Well! you may think the things will mend&mdash;if they won't,
          Lord mend us all!
        </div>
        <div>
          My lady will go in fits, and Mr. Lambert won't need to call;
        </div>
        <div>
          I'll be bound in any money, if I had a guinea to give,
        </div>
        <div>
          He won't sit down again on Chiney the longest day he has to
          live.
        </div>
        <div>
          Poor soul! I only hope it won't forbid his banns of marriage;
        </div>
        <div>
          Or he'd better have sat behind on the spikes of my Lady's
          carriage.
        </div>
        <div>
          But you'll join 'em all of course, and stand poor Mr.
          Lambert's friend,
        </div>
        <div>
          I'll look in twice a day, just to see, like, how they mend.
        </div>
        <div>
          To be sure it is a sight that might draw tears from dogs and
          cats,
        </div>
        <div>
          Here's this pretty little pagoda, now, has lost four of its
          cocked hats.
        </div>
        <div>
          Be particular with the pagoda: and then here's this pretty
          bowl&mdash;

        </div>
        <div>
          Do stick his pigtail on again, and just mend his parasol.
        </div>
        <div>
          But I needn't tell you what to do, only do it out of hand,
        </div>

          Enough of brine to float a navy;

          A cambric kerchief to her eye&mdash;

        <div>
          Put up, instead, with "three removes."

        <div>
          Once on a time&mdash;no matter when&mdash;
        </div>
        <div>
          A knot of very charitable men
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          Set up a Philanthropical Society,
        </div>
        <div class="i2">
          Professing on a certain plan,
        </div>
        <div class="i2">
          To benefit the race of man,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          And in particular that dark variety,

        </div>
        <div class="i2">
          The sable is to ermine,

        <div>
          As smut to flour, as coal to alabaster,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          As crows to swans, as soot to driven snow,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          As blacking, or as ink, to "milk below,"
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          Or yet a better simile to show,
        </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>
          However, as is usual in our city,
        </div>
        <div>
          They had a sort of managing Committee,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          A board of grave responsible Directors&mdash;

        </div>
        <div>
          A Treasurer, of course, to keep the chink,
        </div>
        <div class="i1">
          And quite an army of Collectors!
        </div>
        <div>

        <div class="i1">
          Young, old, and middle-aged&mdash;of all degrees&mdash;

        <div class="i1">
          To rescue Afric's sable sons from fetters&mdash;
        </div>

        <div class="i2">
          Their necks from iron yokes?
        </div>
        <div>
          To end or mitigate the ills of slavery,
        </div>
        <div>
          The Planter's avarice, the Driver's knavery?
        </div>
        <div>
          To school the heathen Negroes and enlighten 'em,

        <div class="i2">
          To polish up and brighten 'em,

        <div>
          Why, no&mdash;the simple end and aim was this&mdash;

          However the poor elves

        </div>
        <div>

          The thing was undeniable!

        <div class="i1">
          To which the skin of the White Man is liable,

        <div class="i1">
          With stiff, strong, saponaceous lather,

        <div>
          It's chanted like the "Dog's Meat Man," or "If I had a
          Donkey."

        <div>
          Whereas, as Mr. Catnach says, and not a bad judge neither,

        <div>
          No ballad&mdash;worth a ha'penny&mdash;has ever come from

        <div>
          Would make a better Chairman for the Glorious Apollers.

        <a name="fn_1" id="fn_1">[1]</a> The authority&mdash;I might
        almost say, the <i>one</i> authority&mdash;for the life of
        Hood, is the <i>Memorials</i> published by his son and
        daughter. Any point which is not clearly brought out in that
        affectionate and interesting record will naturally be equally
        or more indefinite in my brief summary, founded as it is on the
        <i>Memorials</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_2" id="fn_2">[2]</a> "Two years," according to the
        <i>Memorials</i>; but the dates for this portion of Hood's life
        are not accurately given in that work. Hood completed the
        fifteenth year of his age in May, 1814. It is certain, from the
        dates of his letters, that his sojourn in Scotland began not
        later than September, 1815; and the writer of the
        <i>Memorials</i> himself affirms that Hood "returned to London
        about 1820," in or before July. If so, he was in Scotland about
        <i>five</i> years; and, from the fact that he had written in a
        Dundee newspaper in 1814, one might even surmise that the term
        of six years was nearer the mark. At any rate, as he had
        reached Scotland by September, 1815, he was there soon after
        completing his sixteenth year: yet Mr. Hessey
        (<i>Memorials</i>, p. 23) says that he was articled to the
        engraving business "at the age of fifteen or sixteen," and his
        apprenticeship, according to Mr. Hood, junior, lasted "some
        years" even <i>before</i> his transfer from Mr. Sands to Mr. Le
        Keux. The apprenticeship did not begin until after the father's
        death; but the year of that death is left unspecified, though
        the day and month are given. These dates, as the reader will
        readily perceive, are sometimes vague, and sometimes
        contradictory. In the text of my notice, I have endeavored to
        pick my way through their discrepancies.

        <a name="fn_3" id="fn_3">[3]</a> This "Tim, says he," is a
        perfect <i>gag</i> in many of Hood's letters. It is curious to
        learn what was the kind of joke which could assume so powerful
        an ascendant over the mind and associations of this great
        humorist. Here it is, as given in the Hood <i>Memorials</i>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "My dear Friend, I thank my literary fortune that I am not
          reduced like many better wits to barter dedications, for the
          hope or promise of patronage, with some nominally great man;
          but that where true affection points, and honest respect, I
          am free to gratify my head and heart by a sincere
          inscription. An intimacy and dearness, worthy of a much
          earlier date than our acquaintance can refer to, direct me at
          once to your name; and with this acknowledgment of your ever
          kind feeling towards me, I desire to record a respect and
          admiration for you as a writer, which no one acquainted with
          our literature, save Elia himself, will think
          disproportionate or misplaced. If I had not these better
          reasons to govern me, I should be guided to the same
          selection by your intense yet critical relish for the works
          of the great Dramatist, and for that favorite play in
          particular which has furnished the subject of my verses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is my design in the following poem to celebrate by an
          allegory that immortality which Shakspeare has conferred on
          the fairy mythology by his Midsummer Night's Dream. But for
          him, those pretty children of our childhood would leave
          barely their names to our maturer years; they belong, as the
          mites upon the plumb, to the bloom of fancy, a thing
          generally too frail and beautiful to withstand the rude
          handling of time: but the Poet has made this most perishable
          part of the mind's creation equal to the most enduring; he
          has so intertwined the Elfins with human sympathies, and
          linked them by so many delightful associations with the
          productions of nature, that they are as real to the mind's
          eye, as their green magical circles to the outer sense. It
          would have been a pity for such a race to go extinct, even
          though they were but as the butterflies that hover about the
          leaves and blossoms of the visible world. I am, my dear
          friend, yours most truly,
        </p>

        <a name="fn_9" id="fn_9">[9]</a> Hood edited <i>The Gem</i>,
        one of the many annuals of that day, for the year 1829. The
        volume is memorable for having contained his fine poem.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "The remarkable name of Eugene Aram, belonging to a man of
          unusual talents and acquirements, is unhappily associated
          with a deed of blood as extraordinary in its details as any
          recorded in our calendar of crime. In the year 1745, being
          then an usher and deeply engaged in the study of Chaldee,
          Hebrew, Arabic, and the Celtic dialects, for the formation of
          a lexicon, he abruptly turned over a still darker page in
          human knowledge, and the brow that learning might have made
          illustrious was stamped ignominious forever with the brand of
          Cain. To obtain a trifling property he concerted with an
          accomplice, and with his own hand effected the violent death
          of one Daniel Clarke, a shoe-maker, of Knaresborough, in
          Yorkshire. For fourteen years nearly the secret slept with
          the victim in the earth of St. Robert's Cave, and the manner
          of its discovery would appear a striking example of the
          divine justice even amongst those marvels narrated in that
          curious old volume alluded to in the <i>Fortunes of
          Nigel</i>, under its quaint title of 'God's Revenge against
          Murther.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "The accidental digging up of a skeleton, and the unwary and
          emphatic declaration of Aram's accomplice that it could not
          be that of Clarke, betraying a guilty knowledge of the true
          bones, he was wrought to a confession of their deposit. The
          learned homicide was seized and arraigned, and a trial of
          uncommon interest was wound up by a defence as memorable as
          the tragedy itself for eloquence and ingenuity&mdash;too
          ingenious for innocence, and eloquent enough to do credit
          even to that long premeditation which the interval between
          the deed and its discovery had afforded. That this dreary
          period had not passed without paroxysms of remorse may be
          inferred from a fact of affecting interest. The late Admiral
          Burney was a scholar at the school at Lynn in Norfolk when
          Aram was an usher, subsequent to his crime. The Admiral
          stated that Aram was beloved by the boys, and that he used to
          discourse to them of murder, not occasionally, as I have
          written elsewhere, but constantly, and in somewhat of the
          spirit ascribed to him in the poem.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the more imaginative part of the version I must refer
          back to one of those unaccountable visions which come upon us
          like frightful monsters thrown up by storms from the great
          black deeps of slumber. A lifeless body, in love and
          relationship the nearest and dearest, was imposed upon my
          back, with an overwhelming sense of obligation&mdash;not of
          filial piety merely, but some awful responsibility, equally
          vague and intense, and involving, as it seemed, inexpiable
          sin, horrors unutterable, torments intolerable&mdash;to bury
          my dead, like Abraham, out of my sight. In vain I attempted,
          again and again, to obey the mysterious mandate&mdash;by some
          dreadful process the burthen was replaced with a more
          stupendous weight of injunction, and an apalling conviction
          of the impossibility of its fulfilment. My mental anguish was
          indescribable;&mdash;the mighty agonies of souls tortured on
          the supernatural racks of sleep are not to be
          penned&mdash;and if in sketching those that belong to
          blood-guiltiness I have been at all successful, I owe it
          mainly to the uninvoked inspiration of that terrible dream."

        The introduction of Admiral Burney's name makes it likely that
        Hood may have owed his first interest in the story to Charles
        Lamb. The circumstance that the book over which the gentle boy
        was poring when questioned by the usher was called the <i>Death
        of Abel</i>, is by no means forced or unnatural. Salomon
        Gessner's prose poem, <i>Der Tod Abels</i>, published in 1758,
        attained an astonishing popularity throughout Europe, and
        appeared in an English version somewhere about the time of the
        discovery of Aram's crime.

        <a name="fn_10" id="fn_10">[10]</a> <i>The Englishman's
        Magazine</i>, August 1831. This magazine was a venture of
        Edward Moxon, the publisher, but had a career of only seven
        months. It is memorable, however, for including, besides the
        above and various papers by Charles Lamb, poetical
        contributions from Tennyson and Arthur Hallam, and also for
        containing the review by the latter of Tennyson's first volume
        of poems, published in 1830. The beautiful stanzas of Hood's
        appear here, as far as I have discovered, for the first time.
        The date of their composition remains unfixed. Hood's son was
        under the impression that they were written on the death of one
        of his father's sisters, but supplied no evidence bearing on
        the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_11" id="fn_11">[11]</a> These impressive, if rather
        morbid, lines seem to have been hitherto overlooked by Hood's
        editors, and are here collected for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_12" id="fn_12">[12]</a> From Hood's novel of
        <i>Tylney Hall</i>, published in 1834; apparently one of the
        many tender tributes originally addressed by Hood to his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_13" id="fn_13">[13]</a> Written in 1835 after
        Hood's disastrous voyage to Rotterdam, in which the ship was
        nearly lost, and Hood's health was permanently affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_14" id="fn_14">[14]</a> Written at Coblenz, where
        Hood and his family were then settled, in November 1835.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_15" id="fn_15">[15]</a> Assigned by Hood's son to
        the year 1835, but apparently only on conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_16" id="fn_16">[16]</a> Written at Ostend in
        September 1839.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_17" id="fn_17">[17]</a> Originally published by
        instalments in Colburn's <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> in 1840
        and 1841, as one of a proposed series to be entitled "Rhymes
        for the Times."
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_18" id="fn_18">[18]</a> From the opening number of
        <i>Hood's Magazine</i>, January 1844. Written to accompany an
        engraving from a painting by Thomas Creswick, bearing the same
        title.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_19" id="fn_19">[19]</a> Hood's last verses. They
        appeared in his Magazine in February 1845, and were thus
        probably composed during the previous month. In the original
        collection of Hood's serious poems, published after his death,
        they were wrongly assigned to the April of this year. Hood died
        on the third of May.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_20" id="fn_20">[20]</a> In Hood's day Mr. Graham
        was one of a group of distinguished aeronauts which included
        Monck Mason, Hollond, Green, and others. Mr. Graham had made a
        memorable ascent in his Balloon in 1823.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_21" id="fn_21">[21]</a> Elizabeth Fry had set up
        her school for the children in Newgate as early as 1817. Moll
        Brazen, Suky Tawdry, Jenny Diver, and the rest, are names
        borrowed from Gay's <i>Beggars' Opera</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_22" id="fn_22">[22]</a> The well-known
        Humanitarian, M. P. for Galway, the author of "Martin's Act"
        for the protection of animals from ill-treatment, and one of
        the founders of the noble society having the same object. He
        died in 1834.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_23" id="fn_23">[23]</a> After nearly eighty years
        it is almost pardonable to remind the reader that in the
        earlier days of the Waverley Novels their author was much
        talked of by the above title. The variety of Hood's reading,
        and his resource in simile, are very noticeable in this Ode.
        The likening of Dominie Sampson to Lamb's friend, George Dyer
        and the comparison of Mause Headrigg to Rae Wilson on his
        travels, are admirable examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_24" id="fn_24">[24]</a> The famous Arctic explorer
        was engaged for many years, from 1818 onwards, in his various
        efforts to discover the North-West Passage. He died in 1855.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_25" id="fn_25">[25]</a> Hood, for obvious purposes,
        slightly departs from the true spelling of Dr. Kitchiner's
        name. He was an M. D. of Glasgow, who, having been left a
        handsome fortune by his father, abandoned the active practice
        of his profession, and devoted himself to science, notably to
        that of optics, as well as to gastronomy, being himself eminent
        as a gourmet. He was the author of a once famous Cookery Book,
        <i>The Cook's Oracle</i>; and an improved kitchen range still
        bears his name.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_26" id="fn_26">[26]</a> These famous verses were
        first published as from an anonymous correspondent in the
        <i>London Magazine</i>. When Hood reprinted them, under his own
        name, in the first series of <i>Whims and Oddities</i>, he
        prefaced them with the following words:&mdash;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I have never been vainer of any verses than of my part in
          the following Ballad. Dr. Watts, amongst evangelical nurses,
          has an enviable renown; and Campbell's Ballads enjoy a snug,
          genteel popularity. Sally Brown has been favored perhaps with
          as wide a patronage as the Moral Songs, though its circle may
          not have been of so select a class as the friends of
          'Hohenlinden.' But I do not desire to see it amongst what are
          called Elegant Extracts. The lamented Emery, dressed as Tom
          Tug, sang it at his last mortal benefit at Covent Garden; and
          ever since it has been a great favorite with the watermen of
          Thames, who time their oars to it, as the wherrymen of Venice
          time theirs to the lines of Tasso. With the watermen it went
          naturally to Vauxhall, and over land to Sadler's Wells. The
          Guards&mdash;not the mail coach, but the
          Lifeguards&mdash;picked it out from a fluttering hundred of
          others, all going to one air, against the dead wall at
          Knightsbridge. Cheap printers of Shoe Lane and Cow Cross (all
          pirates!) disputed about the copyrights, and published their
          own editions; and in the meantime the authors, to have made
          bread of their song (it was poor old Homer's hard ancient
          case!), must have sung it about the streets. Such is the lot
          of Literature! the profits of 'Sally Brown' were divided by
          the Ballad Mongers;&mdash;it has cost, but has never brought
          me, a halfpenny."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_27" id="fn_27">[27]</a> Of course suggested by
        Coleridge and Southey's <i>Devil's Walk</i>. It is ablaze with
        wit and real imagination. Old nursery tales are not so well
        remembered in these days that it is superfluous to point out
        that the "fee" being a prelude to "faw" and "fum," is taken
        from the formula of the Ogre in <i>Jack and the Bean-Stalk</i>,
        whose usual preliminary to the slaughter of his victims
        was&mdash;

      <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i1">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_28" id="fn_28">[28]</a> Originally published in
        1830 in a thin duodecimo, with illustrations by George
        Cruikshank. It was while Hood was living at Winchmore Hill that
        he had the opportunity of noting the chief features of this
        once famous Civic Revel&mdash;the Easter Monday Hunt&mdash;even
        then in its decadence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_29" id="fn_29">[29]</a> A parody of John Hamilton
        Reynolds's once popular lines, beginning&mdash;

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_30" id="fn_30">[30]</a> Written in the album of
        Miss Smith, daughter of Mr. Horace Smith, of the Rejected
        Addresses. Miss Smith happily still survives to show her
        friends with pride these admirable verses, inscribed in Hood's
        neat and clear handwriting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_31" id="fn_31">[31]</a> Written when Walter Scott
        was familiarly known as the "Wizard of the North," the title
        which is the key to the present poem. Scott died in September,
        1832, in the interval between the writing and the publishing of
        the verses, for which Hood makes regretful apology in the
        Preface to the <i>Comic Annual</i> for 1833, in which they
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_32" id="fn_32">[32]</a> "Edgar Huntley, the
        Somnambulist," was the title of a popular novel of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_33" id="fn_33">[33]</a> A Scotch baronet, and the
        once well-known promoter of Sabbatarian legislation. Sir Andrew
        identified himself in the House of Commons with the efforts of
        an English Association, the "Lord's Day Society," and
        introduced a Bill to prohibit all open labour on Sunday,
        excepting "works of necessity and mercy,"&mdash;a measure
        bound, under any scheme of working, to inflict the direst
        hardship and injustice. After three defeats, the Bill was
        actually carried in 1837, but was afterwards allowed to drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_34" id="fn_34">[34]</a> For the purposes of his pun
        on "night-mare," Hood adroitly utilizes the story of the famous
        Lady Hester Stanhope, whom Kinglake, in his <i>Eothen</i>,
        first made familiar to so many of us. He there speaks of the
        "quiet women in Somersetshire," and their surprise when they
        learned that "the intrepid girl who used to break their vicious
        horses for them" was reigning over the wandering tribes of
        Western Asia!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_35" id="fn_35">[35]</a> This dates from the old
        days of transportation and Botany Bay. The judge indicated was
        Mr. Justice Alan Park, of the Common Pleas, and Mr. Cotton was
        Chaplain of Newgate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_36" id="fn_36">[36]</a> The exquisite wit and fancy
        of these verses need not blind us to their touching
        earnestness. They might well be printed and circulated still in
        the service of the great cause of Early Closing. The "Knight"
        mentioned was, of course, the excellent Charles Knight, pioneer
        and forerunner of all subsequent movements for cheapening and
        popularizing good literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_37" id="fn_37">[37]</a> The daughter of Hood's
        friend William Harvey, the artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_38" id="fn_38">[38]</a> Charles Lamb had been
        reading these verses when he wrote to his friend Dibdin, in
        June, 1896, and called him "Peter Fin Junior."
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_39" id="fn_39">[39]</a> Thomas Moore is a forgotten
        poet, and it cannot therefore be impertinent to remind the
        reader that in his early days he published certain rather "vain
        and amatorious" poems under the pseudonym of "Thomas Little."
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_40" id="fn_40">[40]</a> The muffin-boy, with his
        "evening bell," is still in the land; but the evening postman,
        perambulating the streets and collecting letters "just in
        time," has "passed away" for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_41" id="fn_41">[41]</a> These verses form a good
        specimen of Hood's capabilities for writing to order. They
        first appeared in the <i>Bijou</i> for 1828, accompanying a
        vignette by Thomas Stothard of two knights, mounted, and in
        complete armor, engaged in deadly conflict. This was doubtless
        (after the then custom of <i>Annuals</i>) placed in Hood's
        hands for him to supply the appropriate letterpress.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_42" id="fn_42">[42]</a> The allusion to our modern
        "Black Prince" is apparently to Prince Le Boo, whose death,
        while on a visit to England, had so impressed the public
        imagination. He came, however, from the Pelew Islands, not the
        "Sandwich;" and it was smallpox, not measles, that "took him
        off."
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_43" id="fn_43">[43]</a> "The Deserted Village."
        Illustrated by the Etching Club.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_44" id="fn_44">[44]</a> This Poem was doubtless one
        of the results of Hood's residence in Germany. It is suggested
        apparently in about equal proportions by the Walpurgis-night in
        <i>Faust</i>, and Schiller's <i>Gang nach dem Eisenhammer</i>.
        Possibly Hood had been stirred up to the attempt by Retzsch's
        outlines. He has mixed up localities with the utmost freedom,
        the Harz, the Black Forest, and the Scene of Schiller's Poem.
        The influence of the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i> is obvious
        throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="fn_45" id="fn_45">[45]</a> "The Row at the Oxford
        Arms" (to quote its alternative title) is a squib on the
        contest at Oxford, in 1841-42, for the Professorship of Poetry.
        The candidates, it will be remembered, were Isaac Williams and
        Mr. (afterwards Archdeacon) Garbett. The struggle was the more
        intense that it was openly acknowledged to be a trial of
        strength between the adherents of the "Oxford Movement" and the
        Evangelical Party.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
